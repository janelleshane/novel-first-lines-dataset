My name is Nicholas and I am here, at last, to tell you that there once was a place, or place-that was, no doubt a time-when you and your fellows were more or less of the same mind and more or less of the same religion, and even more or less in possession of the same memories of past events, and that there was no such thing as evil in the universe and no such thing as good in it, and that evil had but one aim-that of destroying and destroying, and that the worst of it was done by a few, and that the best of it was the good of mankind, and that the best belonged to the best of mankind, and that if you had been sensible of this, you would have been very differently disposed towards fortune and fortune's sake in turn, and that good fortune tended, in the main, to the prosperity of all, and that bad fortune tended to the ruin of all, and that sometimes bad fortune came to pass at the expense of good fortune, and sometimes good fortune did not come to pass at all.

– I was a girl of twelve when something terrible happened, something that I still have the misfortune of having to deal with every day, though in a greatly altered form.

– I'm not supposed to come up here, but that's what I do, and I am making this report precisely as it has been passed on to me; and although it seems strange to me that I should be obliged to write down everything that I have seen or heard in the course of a long and arduous career, I am compelled to do it.

– The plaster-work of the walls and ceiling of the city of Memphis, with the shining windows of its cemeteries, magnificence, splendour, charm, and cunning had never looked better, and the atmosphere of the city was still as the days of old, or as when it had been in habit a city of art and splendour and excellency.
