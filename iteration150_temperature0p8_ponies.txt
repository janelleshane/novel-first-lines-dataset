Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes. Pinkie must have gone to the royal court. Rainbow was advancing towards the brides, wearing a pointed black frock, a black skirt even shorter than her hips, and heels that reached just below her knees. They wore flowing white dresses, or rather, they wore dresses like they were made of paper. All those years of stick-figure cartoon ponies that had been created by the Evil Weasels had all been wiped out, and now there was nothing but the images of ponies hoofing around a campfire. None of them, that is, when Twilight had the chance to show them.
The sun rose over the Crystal Empire.

Stars shone brightly in the sky as in the summer, yet they were not the same colors, for they did not come from the same source.
"You knocked me out, did you little bitch?" Princess Cadence said.
The sun was shining.
"I know what you're thinking--" said Twilight haltingly. 
Rainbow Dash rubbed at her shoulder.
A massive cloud of earth and sky loomed over the Crystal Empire.
The mountains of Equestria were beautiful.
"So you're not the military, then?"
Rainbow Dash rose from the carriage deck, moved over to the open window, looked up and down at the cloudy, sunny day.
Rainbow Dash sat down on the edge of the bank, crossed her legs, and stared out at the sea beyond the bank.
"The mighty wind howls!"
Rainbow Dash stood on the bank that led out from the good community of Manehattan, reaching out for the calm breeze that blew from the dry mountain air.
I am a king's child, and the title of lord-sergeant-at-arms has been held by me ever since I became a princess, for I have been determined to prove to myself that I am worthy of it.

Rainbow Dash had always been a bridesmaid; her father had promised a wedding for her and had lived up to that.

In the time of Queen Elizabeth I, the boundary of the country between the two kingdoms of England and Scotland, was divided into two or three hundred and eighty feet wide, forty feet high, and one hundred and fifty feet wide; from whence came the name of the place, no doubt, because it was divided by a thin boundary, which, at all events, entered into the name only of the place.

Rainbow Dash had her own set of sparrow feet.
The stars are parted, and the blackness of space is filled with light.
Rainbow Dash lay in her white cotton dress, looking out through the bars at the stars overhead, and the old King of the Hill of the Meadow, the abbot of the church of St. John the Baptist; and all the life of the world was passing before her.
At first sight, the Earth looks like an ordinary, everyday place.
Her eyes were glassy and her brain had no thoughts.
Rainbow Dash had been working on her wings for four years when she discovered that she was pregnant.
The La Salle night was full of dreams and heart-pounding terror.
"The storm is over, my lovely, and good.
The storm has ended."
Shiro wanted to be like everyone else.
The sun was shining.
Head-high, high on the high bank of the Changeling, nestled in the deep, far from the rest of the world, nestled like a baby in the sand, and the moon shining over the top of the big rock on the bank, there sat a pretty little girl who had been crowned queen by her sisters,

Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
"That's the worst scene in the history of our world!" said Shining Armor.
The scene was dead quiet.
"Molly!" said the Sheriff of the village.
The sun is shining warm and clear over the foothills of Spindell.
You got this idea for a Friday afternoon shoot?
"I know it's a thing of beauty, but as far as the eye goes, this is the worst day of the week."
Nothing changes in the world like the succession of opportunities that are waiting to be seized.
"Of course you've been through worse. The sickness, the hair. Johnny died of a broken heart. The twins were killed by an angry dog.
Perdell entered the kitchen wearing a pair of muddy pants and a flannel shirt.
"Don't forget," said the doctor, "to drink the water."
This is the story of a girl.
I am Flutterwater.
"Shall we write down our observations?" said the doctor.
"What's the plan?" asked 'isiah'.
"How do I know when we have finished?"
Rain and smoke.
"Here he is," said the doctor.
I heard the crack of the wagon horn as it swung into the clearing.
The fair maiden had been slain.
"Not now, you bloody coward!"
It began, as all history does, as the work of some madman.
"Harry, when was the last time you did something wrong?"
Evia Leraris stood in front of the camera, her eyes bluish as a heart.
The morning air was crisp and fresh, and with a threadbare air of autumnal green, the air of the simple little village of Summerport, Maine.
She was far away, so distant that it was hard to remember when she had come.
The boat with the smiling black face had left the dock and the narrow dark waters of the river Styx behind.
The evil spirit that had been under the portico of the federal building in Washington Square, New York, for three days, and had been detected at the entrances of all the federal buildings in the city, jumped from the banks of the river through the narrow gates of the City Hall and down the street, into the recesses of the busy thoroughfares of this city.
"We are ready, sir."
This is a story of courage, of bravery, of sacrifice, of whom we speak only in the names of Sir, Mr., Madam, and of the honourable gentleman, Sir Thomas Gower, in whose service we have been engaged; in whose service, moreover, we have had occasion to pay tribute of gratitude and countenance of respect, as well as of esteem and respect; for what is more honourable than to render to any man by your example the respect due to a trusted minister?
The moon soon stopped shining.
The painting of the creeper, once done, is as beautiful a piece of art as any in the world.
The sea was calm and silent.
I am a bad boy, and I have been a bad boy.
It is a beautiful day, when all the sunshine meets the blue sky.
When a sunbeam sheds a green leaf, the moment it has been cast in the otherwise dreary, cold-infested, grey-streaked face of a dead city, it bestows upon it the quality and the charm of life, both of beauty and of conversation.
On the 18th of June, 1911, the eldest son of Mr. and Mrs. Albert Ann Elbridge, of Ashford, on the south bank of the Thames, of a family of respectable repute, was born poor, worthless, and occasionally seen in bed with a woman of wealth.
There are many strange stories that we might not succeed in telling at once, should we wish it.
I have written it down, that I may be able to give it to my father, who may find some use for it in his service, while I shall have some amusement for myself, if my father will permit me.
I do not remember what age I sat down to play-house fare.
The sun was just coming up when I finished my morning homework.
I remember a certain little girl whose name I do not like, but who loved the same thing that I did; and I remember, too, that she was born a little after the year 1852, that she was of the small family, of the same kind as myself, though no one of that family should have been more than ten years my senior; and that her father, however strong and though very good-looking, had no money, which only bordered on the imaginary, while she had everything else desired, and that everything she asked for was granted her without any regard to the wants of others.
At the end of the long and drawn-
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
"And what's that one for?" said our mother.
She was lying on the floor of her room, bending forward.
The sun set for one last time; the sky turned to greyness.
It was the brightest day of the autumn when the grand old house stood in the middle of the red-wood forest.
It was not a bad summer for the pink-and-white-striped ponies.
The sun was setting as I stood in my own bedroom, looking out the window.
My name is Twilight Sparkle.
I was born with magical wings.
It was a big week at the fair, with a lot of worrying about the runaways and a lot of snatching apples from the children.
When Celestia woke in the morning, she found herself in the middle of a grand, wide, open airship.
"Twilight?" said Princess Celestia.
The sun was shining brightly and the clouds were clear as glass.
Twilight sat on her hind legs on the deck of the large ship, watching the sun set on the horizon.
It was a beautiful day on the banks of the moon.
It had been a hard year.
They all have that one thing.
This is the story of how I fell in love with the world.
Through the doorway of the house opposite the portmanteaus, the gray clouds parted and the moonlight shone on the bare-brained faces of the people who lived there.
The sun was shining brightly and the sky was clear as crystal.
It was the night when Applejack lost her hooves.
A hole in the ground yawned, an enormous hole.
Pinkie Pie stood on the bank of the river, waiting.
One day, when she was only eight years old, my family lived in a house down on the side of a farm.
"It's not your fault," said the kitchen voice in my ear.
"It's not your fault," said the other wing of the Aeryn.
I should say I knew much before I was born, but what I could remember is quite a long story.
There were three of us.
It was known that there was a flower which, before it bloomed, if the wind were at all favourable, could produce a luminous and lovely flower, and which was ever in great demand in the city about the water's end.
The moon was beginning to smoke.
In my seventeen years I have lost count of the times who asked me to write a book, and I have never in all those years, from the earliest childhood, the reluctance to do so appeared to me to have been entirely unconscious.
Moody was hunting down a rabbit when he heard the awful noise of the gunfight.
The Princess was riding her horse down Mount Fouladuddy when it happened, and was having a quite a pleasant ride.
The great purple flower, which blew from the dawn sky, was in bloom in the town of Valais.
The town of Valais was a vast and shining city.
It was the first day of spring in the year of our Prince's coronation, and Lady Margaret of the Forest of the Southern Sea was up at the royal court to welcome him to the throne; but the weather had already turned hot and dry and the first-born were already starting to be gone.
When we count the dead in the Town of the Rivers, we don't really know what we're talking about; for these are the very rivers that flow through this important city of the British Empire, and through which, during the sixteen years of the reign of King Henry I., Sir John Hunter, of the year of his coronation, made such a marked contribution to the commercial and military prosperity of the city of London, that, when he departed, he found with what an affection and tenderness of mind and mind alone did he devote himself to the administrative and financial affairs of the city, and was so much astonished by the extraordinary extent of the public debt that he waited until he had collected a sufficient sum of money from the public, before he was obliged to admit his own helplessness and to employ his entire energies in the pressing business of default during some years of the reign of King Henry I.
Mal-Mowj, the king of the Ronan, was growing old and his countenance was sinking into an expression of vexation like a fish in the midst of a stream.
Four months after my marriage the Events unfolded themselves in a manner which, in spite of all my efforts to prevent it, I can scarcely conceive.
Eden stood on the bridge of the Nile, watching the stream which flowed through his garden.
When Montrose was thirteen years old he dated his first book, "In a Sentence or an Exposition, I Have the Honour to Write," for something like three months, noting the date, and so casting some doubt
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes. Spring was in full force.
It is the year of the Stallion", said the black tunic-clad stallion that stood there, looking out over the Sea of Clouds, to the black clouds that turned serene when the moon shone down like a silvery mirror.
"I wouldn't trust him, if only he were real. I'd give him my tongue," said the gleam of his unicorn horn in Pinkie Pie's pearly paling eyes.
"I'm gonna have to get you a ride, Celestia."
The sun was shining, and magic had healed the world.
The idea of it all still seemed very new.
It was like visiting the future and not being there yet.
Buck the brown-skinned stallion of the Earth Pony of Croaterdale had been out all night.
A little over an hour after they were done with their quarters the villagers of Moéroul had begun to pack up their cars.
"Aw, well done, rubbing down a strange palace. That's another one of our nice wood-panelled rooms, isn't it?"
The sun rose before dawn.
"Windscream, stop beating that clatter!"
My name is Starlight Glimmertail.
Two thousand years ago, the first pigs appeared in Britain.
The sun was dazzling with thermal heat.
From the edge of the Cornish Dunes, a battered but stunning 3-seater roadship drifted through thick, heavy fog.
In a little over two weeks time I will begin my two hundred and first day on the job as an officer in the Royal Navy.
It had almost been a week since the last of the Summer Soldiers had left the last of their camp in the western provinces.
It was a warm afternoon in April, the watch of the royal court being to witness the first trial of the Queen's youngest daughter, who was being tried for treason, and who had been suspected of having been in league with her brother, the Marquis of Wardrobe.
The moon was beginning to set.
When the son of the man who had once been king of the West of Ireland and was now Lord of Waterford was killed, it happened that he had six daughters, two known to the world, and two known to his friends and family.
The king of Zanzibar was dead, and so was the final king of the galaxy.
It was the end of the thirty-first year of the reign of King Elias of the Melanesian empire.
Round about the clock, in the central chamber of the Temple of the Moon at Gringalaun, the smallest of the circumstances of the planet Sol was worked up.
The vacuum of space is immense.
Twelve of us stood in the street, facing the city, and we all felt as if we were standing on the banks of the Thames.
Flying high in a much-loved airplane, Amy saw a man through the window of his bedchamber.
In the city of alabaster, a land where weather is silver, where water is gold, and where the moon is a red-gold aquamarine, there sits a hamlet called Omod, in which the sun shines for a reason.
There were four horses, and a boy named Jack.
Several days ago, while everyone was running from bathing to bathing, there entered my father's country that befell the great Danes, the name of which is Lily and is that of Lily's father.
The moon shone up from some deep vault of blue, and shone all night long through the streets of London, through the tall apartment-temples of ancient monarchs, and in the great halls of noble houses, where all the lives of their predecessors had been celebrated.
The sun had set, and the steerswoman of the ship had gone home, with her mer-dog in a fiddle-and-trumpet and her little mare in a carton, her master in command of the galley.
We are a Continental army of three hundred and fifty-seven; and for a long, long time past I never saw so many men in the same place at the same time.
I saw my mother and father hanging by their necks from an upstairs window, descending from the sixth floor, toward the courtyard behind the house.
The king's daughter was about to take her maiden-head to court.
I dreamt that I was born to rule the world; but that I had been sent by my great-uncle the king of England, who, without any pretence whatsoever, had bestowed on me the title of 'Lady of the Queens of the House of the Lord,' to instruct and instruct me in the use of the sword.
Three or four years ago, when I was quite fifteen, I started writing a history of my favourite country.
Hand in hand with the advent of the king
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
"You would make a great pony, would you not? I was sure you were destined to be one, Twilight."
"Oh, I'm sorry. I don't know why."
"Look at that look on that dark-skinned man's face!"
Twilight thrashed about on all fours, helping her hooves through the dusty soil like a frightened child.
The moon was golden.
She had always liked the sea, but not when it was full of glittering ships.
"It is the perfect ambience."
Good morning, all!
The sun set without warning and it wasn't long before the town was teeming with activity.
Nothing is as it seems, Twilight thought, as the beast hoofed through the darkness of the night.
The sad story of how my mother and father died and of how I became a Princess is the longest story I've ever written, and possibly the longest story that has ever been told.
"You have the right hoofs, Applejack!"
"Rainbow Dash is my best friend. She doesn't remember me being born but she's right; I have the best hooves on the staff of Everfree. The best in magic. And she really likes me, but that doesn't bother her much anymore."
"We must stop it, princess!"
"Rainbow Dash, why don't you just give up and get lost?"
"I don't know what happened to you when you went..."
Three desert sand dunes, one pitch-dark, one sand-cloaked, one sand-overgrown.
It is said that the worst nightmares of the dead always come true.
There's only so much you can take of a purple, emerald-colored earth, and this world is no exception.
"It is a beautiful day."
"Look, it's only a day, you know. It's normal. We can go back to the park tomorrow and take care of each other."
Rainbow Dash had always been a weatherpony.
The air of the city was glassy, but it wasn't for the lack of rain.
"Did you hear that?"
The sky was a clear blue and the night was calm.
The only thing that ever beats my heart like a dragon is the sound of her wings beating.
The weather was clear and warm, but it was still a cold, windy, and windy day.
It was already too late for the storm.
The rainy day was dark, and the sun was barely up when twilight fell.
It was a cold, windy day in the desert, and my brother and I were going into the mountains to climb a peak.
Darkness, mightier despite its dimensions, than thought, drew deep in the heart of the world.
The sun shone bright in this cloudy Texas summer.
But it was just a trap.
The sun shone dimly in this battered section of Texas landscape.
Once upon a time, the universe was full of stars.
His arms were like needles, and his head was like a sea.
A train filled with people ran down a long, dark, winding track.
In the city of Nurgle, a thousand miles below the surface of the moon, its passengers ossified into the sickly state of decay.
The town of Summer, which stood like an egg on a highway, was a city in the middle of a vast plain.
"Happy anniversary!"
He usually sat at his desk and wrote in a notebook.
I remember the first time I saw the upper west side of San Francisco.
Twelve years ago, I was nearly twelve years old, but I still remember the day I saw my crush on the other side of the sea.
The tapestries in the windows at the end of the bridge above Lefthand Street are a mess of black tangled paper, which can never be quite certain which direction it is facing.
On the last of September, 1864, the last of the last classes of the Admiralty Academy, at St. Mary's, of the University of London, was dismissed as a waste of talent and momentary expense.
The priest looks down at the little coffin in front of the door of the casket, where the body lies.
A week ago when I was twenty-one years old, I came across an author who told a story that interested me.
The traveler was a man of the people, and at the time that he was travelling so very far, that he was not aware of its importance.
"Is this all right?"
The sky was gray, and the earth felt heavy; if the wind were to blow it would have been a warm spring day in the town.
When she is dead, the fair countess should be consulted.
Not long ago in the year 1613, a
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes. She was a bit tired, having made it three hours from here and had no idea how much longer that would last.
Flambole is the only Pony here who knew where the break room was.
"The Equestrian Fancy is on the line," the stallion said.
The party was still in full swing, and the first person to arrive was Princess Celestia.
"I wonder what am I going to do now?"
This story was originally published in the October 2013 issue of Not a Blog, a monthly issue of which gave us a taste of what's to come... and didn't make any reference to the events taking place in the rest of the world, either.
Twilight is sitting with her wings folded, legs crossed at the navel.
"I'm in bed... but it's not really any good," Twilight said, looking up at the ceiling.
Nobody knew how old Twilight was. Maybe it was something, she wondered.
The moon was shining hooves like out of a sunny good boy's mouth.
Hearing that a pegasus had been shot in Canterlot at the end of the summer vacation, Twilight couldn't help but feel a bit sad.
Shining hooves, magenta in the daylight, flew through the open courtyard, whistle-like horns making a low crescendo of the air.
"The end is near," Fluttershy thundered into Celestia, "he will let you down."
"Noooooooooo," said Rainbow Dash as the final hoof of the wing smashed into the ouside wall of the throne room. "Someday... someday, my brave friends, when we shall all be in our hundreds, you will find our script to be lost and forgotten.
The hunt was on for the magical unicorn egg, the only one that had ever been missing.
The earth trembled.
"Thank you, Princess," Twilight said, grinning.
"I'm going to bed, the sun with its golden rays shines down upon the open fields once more."
"Rainbow Dash, you're the best dinner musician I know, and not just because you're a colorless pink pony. You're doing a damn fine job, giving the order to the cooks, of which I have only a few dozen friends, all in pink. Here, show the kitchen, and we'll... and this is what we've been waiting for, we'll all come to see."
Rainbow Dash was perched on the edge of a high bank, snapping the last few pennies from her neck when she heard the call of an emergency.
"Ponies, time to get ready for work!"
Twilight Sparkle
"Stroll on in, Pinkie-Mare. There's a new pony on the line."
This story was originally published in the December 2013 issue of Ponyville in the magazine Apple Family.
Hello, my name is Pinkie Pommel, and I'm a writer and a connoisseur of both the magic of words and my object of desire, the soft violet petals that are the delicate and delicate flower of the many poncies of the Acropolis.
Fluttershy was sitting on the edge of the beach, lost in thought.
The sun was painting the sea of stars blue.
We're in the town of Colors, a slightly rundown little town spread out over the northern reaches of what is now the Kingdom of Hoofington, and in that is the home of the people who have come to call it the Kingdom of the Propelling Adversary because they think they are superior in every respect to their fellows.
I think thinking back to my childhood and having all that magic and the little amount of it that I have it is probably better for any individual than to try to remember everything that happened.
Twilight only liked magic.
There was once a king and the queen, all in one body, who had every right to be queen. 
Fluttershy cracked open her newspaper, nudged the option beneath the headline Today, I was going to write a story about a man who, if I ever met him in person, I would kill first.
The nicest card I've ever had in my life... I've been wondering why I have to do this to myself, and for a long time I guess I went along with it because it's what society had told me, but it wasn't right, and I don't like the idea of having to do it.
"It wasn't right," I said, "but..."
Fluttershy was standing on the street with her back to the house, looking up at the huge dark building which, between her legs, was partially illuminated by the darkness of the night. 
A house was five miles away, on the other side of the water, and lay there in a quiet place, which was good, for the
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
"Twilight, I have something for you."
"I think I'm going to kill you, Rainbow."
"Quiet, pony."
"Well, that was quick. I'm going to go do something."
"Oh, Celestia. An Applejack. If you have something to show me..."
"Elemental magic?"
"Sparkle, are you going to do it?"
"Celestia, come sit down."
"Ooooohhhh!"
"I can feel it, Sparkle!"
"Rainbow Dash, come on, say something!"
"Yes, Cadence!"
"Rainbow Dash, do it, you're going to die."
"Rainbow Dash, come on, say something!"
"Rainbow Dash, please! You're going to die, all right?"
"Rainbow Dash, get up."
"Rainbow Dash, come on!"
"Rainbow Dash, can you feel it? I don't know if I believe you!"
Rainbow Dash trotted up to Twilight.
"That's it, Dash. That's it. No more. I failed."
Twilight Sparkle leaned against the railing of the train.
Twilight walked through the empty city like a ghost.
Rainbow Dash lay in a ball on the seat beside her.
Rainbow Dash lay in a flurry of spindly limbs that were too small to have legs.
"It has been a long month of bad news for me, my friends, and my pony friends."
Twilight sat on the edge of the grass, watching the ponies she loved die.
The sun drenched the mountain from the west.
The sun set below Hoofstark's head.
The sun rose through the blackness of the desert.
Sirius watched as his master walked up to the throne.
Clouds of dust and dust rose from the floor, wandels of shining dust, and drifted in the breeze.
There was a man in the very heart of my soul.
It was only the last night of my life that I gave any thought to the future.
The town was deserted.
It was a cold day in the spring of 1909.

The day he tried to kill himself was the first night of his life.
He was sitting on the edge of a tarpaulin in a crowded room with the windows down when the voice whispered in his ear.
I have seen a lot of scientists, but I can't remember the last one who thought he could do something as trivial, as stupid, as complete as dying.
The day he hurt himself in an automobile accident was the first day of his life.
The princess of the Blue Sea, who lived in a castle on a beach just off the coast of central Queensland, had three children, called Felicia, Sarah and Charis.
It was the death of an old flame, and I was the only one hurt.
The great staircase whirred and shuffled with the ticking of keys and the ringing of the bell, sending down from the ceiling the weight of people, including him, who had never before stood above the keyhole.
Sirius Bright watched in horror as he watched another man die.
One late summer Saturday a young Californian named Theodore Wallace Till of Oregon, born in 1869, died.
One morning, far away in the great Pacific beyond the stars, a young man named Dick Sheldon Blaine, of Boston, came upon a few strange pieces of paper in a drawer of his mother's room.
The Founders were aware of the power of magic and of the possibility of turning the weather.
The first sounds of life came from the mountains, where there were many great stone walls.
I am the cyclops of the sea.
After the thirteen million years of regular human history, when all the kingdoms, empires and nations of the earth ceased to exist, there existed only one people: the human race.
The whole of Asia and of Europe and America was divided into nine principal parts by the great river Kwai, which flows through Asia and Europe.
Once, in a long, long time, a man died and rose again.
There were five hundred and sixty-seven million years of existence on the earth at that time--and only three months elapsed.
I am a part of the Order of the White Eagle, who was founded in the year 1787.
Near the end of the last century, it may be, there came as a terrible surprise to man himself, that from the first days of the world until the end of the last, he had not been able to reckon with one hundred and fifty millions of years.
He was dressed in a purple suit, a thrice reinforced one, with a gold cross in the front.
Before flight, men always believed that if they would only fly, they would see the
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes. She was beginning to get quite worn out, though she hadn't intended for her obsession to get out of control.
The sun was just beginning to set when the poor pony would have to begin the day with an appointment, but she'd had enough of searching though the books and the blue drawers of the hospital wing and was using every ounce of energy she had left to push through the crowd and make her way to the small circular room that was her office. 
It was only a little after one at night that the river ran clear of the dark and the rain had ceased to fall.
At first the English and their allies, led by Lord Berkeley, passed through what they called the West-India Town, a formidable fortress astride the narrow banks of the Thames.
"A cup of tea for Tinker!"
"It's all right, Sweetie Belle," said the little pony who had been brought up on the hooves of others, because it was always good to know what the other was thinking or doing, and if she was right, she was always wiser than she was.
Rainbow Dash sat up on the front step of the house with her eyes closed.
It was only a few months ago that Pinkie Pie used to complain about the ponies always coming to the same place and it always being late.
The great dragon, known as the Bulge, my liege lord, ruler of the unswerving throng, is nigh at hand.
Veterinarian Dr. Surprise walked patiently, looking down from his perch on the magma-scouring furnace of the Royal Flush Chamber, where a, skeletal stallion stood in a gooey state.
The clock is ticking, and it's getting harder and harder to stay awake.
It was only yesterday that my parents, who had spent most of their lives on the south-western shores of the Isle of Man, got to know the place that I now call Devon.
The chamber was filled with the soft, mournful hum of the sea.
I'm on top of the table when Dash comes in.
The rest of them will love me, but I am not one of those.
"Just go in, baby, and don't scare the dogs."
The first day I ever met Myron on the loose-leafed hills of the Colorado, a rattlesnake had slashed his leg, severing a lot of flesh and leaving him with one leg.
The night the S'llans died, I met them in the house of the real estate mogul, Mr. Florentine's son, Mr. Ansel.
There was once a boy with a large house and a beginning-of-age daughter.
It is a famous story that in Troy, when there was still war and yet was not yet deserted, a king, by the name of Ulysses, who was the son of Pindar, had the good sense to decide to make peace.
Mare lay on her side in the hot sun, exhausted and almost blind.
It was a hot, dry, foggy day in June of the year 2232.
It had been a week since the war.
It was a long, hot and windy trip for the petunia-pony to the village of the banks of the river Darien.
A bright flash of green light enveloped me as I slid into the darkened stable.
The sky was always the darkest and most threatening place in the world, for it was always the last place to which a pony should turn to escape the heat of the farming fields, or to escape the chilling cold of the deep, or to avoid the danger of the unknown.
The bomb lands somewhere on the roof.
"Mare I am flying the livery show of the town."
"I cannot believe what I have just done, Perry."
The white clouds above the sky had gone by long enough for the sun to rise far enough in the north to make the sky glow as though sunlight shone upon it.
The sun was shining down upon the great town of Ponyville.
The sun rose three times in two days and for another twenty-four hours, and it shone brilliantly, but for the air and the sky below.
The whole world was watching, waiting for the outrageous act that would shake the foundations of human civilization.
The rooms were all right.
The sun rose slowly in the morning but it was very clear that it was not long before it was going to rise very heavily.
The noise of flying and the sounds of battle made the wind in the marsh all the more dreadful. 
When I was small, I knew nothing about magic.
There was once a world where the stars hung in the sky like jewels atop a buyer's waist, and every one knew where the moon lay in the sky.
The air of the Southern Wasteland burned with the heat of a
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes. 
Twilight looked down at the jumble of rosebuds and the pink confection of amarets lining the counter. 
"Silence."
Moves this story to the back of the store for ease of storage.
I miss the days when it was all about being born and rising to the top.
Twilight polishes the edges of her wings.
"Try and look at that, Rainbow Dash." 
Applejack stood up. 
"Rainbow Dash, if you don't mind my asking, why are you wearing that dress?"
Rainbow Dash stood there, expressionless, arms crossed.
This story begins with the first straw of the morning and ends with the day the rain finally stopped thawing.
Rainbow Dash sat on a rock on the banks of his stream and stared out at the water in disbelief. "That's impossible, Rarity," he said, "that's impossible, even for great magic!"
Rainbow Dash sat down on the rock and stared out at the water in disbelief.
Applejack sat down on the top of the tallest pony, Fluttershy.
When the Great and sudden flood of a huge and still-swirling ocean washed all the water from the land up to the peak of the great lake, it fell over the cities and towns in a swift, destructive manner.
Fluttershy stood beneath the shadow of the arch, watching the water move by.
The world looked shattered, the stars all gone and all the world had changed.
The water was as big as a house, and the water was the same colour as water.
Lo and behold!
Fluttershy sat on a rock, gazing out into the water, wonderment running in her cheeks.
One day, it was just a story.
Rainbow Dash sat down on the rock and stared out into the water.
 
The shadow of a hoof reached out, and outstretched a hoof sized horn. 
Rainbow Dash sat on her rock and blinked her eyes, wondering how to get back to reality.

Ever since Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Roxton of Silvercourt landed here, they have been fortunate enough to have remained in the same house, which they had rented with their parents for some months being away on business.
A humble little house, with a very modest backyard, a very humble but well-fed but not very well-paid tenant, and that person, for the time being, Miss Elizabeth Swindon, who had been a housemaid in the old days of the family, mostly in the East End of London, — for now, of course, we are going to speak of the family that has been in existence for nearly 200 years; it is impossible to exaggerate the importance which this house brought to the family; nor can any one who has investigated its circumstances ever gain a more complete view of the facts.

A critter had clawed its way through the fingers of Twilight's wing.
"Rainbow Dash, I really don't know what to say anymore."
"My...my friends..."
The deep blue waters of the ocean at the very edge of the archipelago of Equestria seemed to gleam with an awe-inspiring radiance, as if it had been watching over them from the very beginning.
Rainbow Dash sat on her saddle and looked around the sea, sliding her hooves gently through the pegasus's smooth underbelly.
Rainbow Dash lifted her head, and peered out over the horizon.
Rainbow Dash had seen each of the color patterns on her own body.
Rainbow Dash sat on her saddle and watched the sunset.
It was a good day all right.
On a summer morning when it was hot enough to make the last drops of water fall from the mountains, Rainbow Dash found herself riding through the dark of a golden autumn, where golden leaves fell among the tall, yellow-blooming trees and fell in a variety of shades of green.
Rainbow Dash sat mainly on her hind legs, bridling the fierce thirst of the black mare.
Rainbow Dash sat on her saddle and watched the sun rise over the high hills.
Rainbow Dash was dreaming a good dream.
Rainbow Dash was sketching a town in the snow, when she turned to see the stars shining brightly in the evening sky.
Rainbow Dash sat on her saddled legs and stared down at her hooves, wondering what the terror of the demon spell cast down on the citizens should have been like.
Rainbow Dash was an Equestrian princess, but in the eyes of the law it was a strange and difficult situation to be in.
Rainbow Dash was at the dinner-party, waiting for her mother, Princess Celestia, to apologize for not coming sooner.
The sun shone brightly on the night sky.
The moon was blue, and, as the eyes of little children could see, it had a broad and graceful aspect.
Then, when they had all gone to bed, the sun shone up for the first time since it had been first put out.
I didn't know what to do.
It was a dark, rainy night and the crow's wings were fluttering in the wind.
Rainbow Dash sat on the deck and watched over the sea of stars that stretched out before her.
The first time Twilight had seen her father, when he had been a boy called Spike.
It was a cold, dark, windless day, and it had started on a bright and sunny Sunday morning in Yorkshire.
It was the eleventh year of Mr. Dash's life, and he had been so busy with business of which he did not know at the time just how many it involved—foremost of all, business in the real world.
He had heard the talk of a great city, but he had never seen any of it.
The sun shone brightly on the evening sky.
She was elated, all right.
The night was cold. 
She had to go, though.
The ground shook with a sickening crunch.
"I think you should come on now," said the mare rather than my wife or myself.
My name is Omany, and I come to tell you that I am now pregnant!"
The sun rose slowly, towards the edge of the archipelago.
It was a strange day.
The sun rose slowly for the first time in the history of Equestria.
Princess Celestia sat down on the golden throne in her tower, and she looked out at the sea of stars that stretched before her.
Tilting her back, she looked up at the stars above her.
The ending of the first book I ever read was a

The thick black smoke of the old Indian funeral of the west coast city of Roseland hung high in the sky.
There was nothing like the smell of the desert in a city.
"I'm going out to enjoy myself."
The sun was like a piece of an egg.
Rain, with its large, silvery white dust clouds, was falling hard and fast.
"What's takin' down three quarters of the sunlights?"
"The sun, sweetheart. Took the three-quarters out of the sun."
"You got a new-found talent for doing absurd things."
"Four is a good number for a camera, but not a good one for a sensor, and still less a film camera, and not a good one for the lens, especially not one for the same focal length as the one you're using one for now. Five is not a good number for a camera, but it's a good one for a sensor."
"What the hell is happening?"
"I know nothing about my race or my world. I've only known half of it, though, and I'm going to move on, but I couldn't care less now, especially not for the money that's come with it."
"This is so strange."
"What the fuck is happening?"
"I was born in an ancient and mostly forgotten civilization. My parents were born in a city called Acapulco. They had to keep everything clean and spare because the city had too many bad people, and the thieves didn't like the smell of waste. They were born in a house that they still had."
"It's raining, clouds and all, and we're standing here, still sitting on the same spot, tomorow, at the middle of the city."
"A bright, shining star shone through the darkness."
"I'm sorry to have to tell you this―publicly and privately―that I am completely insensible to any legitimate form of affection."
"Are you hiding something?"
"Beloved," said the voice from the dimlights, "take a look around."
"From where I'm standing, this city is in the grip of a great drought."
"I have no choice but to remind you of the historical importance of your house."
"The sun, shining brightly, rose up in the summertime, and from the bright highpoint it shone down on the stricken city of Alexandria."
"My name is Oscar Garcia, and I am a citizen of the United States."
"All day long, I sat in the kitchen, under the steaming hot tepid water of the stove, pouring out the tamales that my father, I believe, made for me in the days before the American Revolution, and in which I also deeply enjoyed the taste, even in that ill-favoured age, of chills.
"The stench of death and decay filled the air.
Since the beginning of the year four thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, the dust has settled and the dust has begun to pick back.
"This is all very well, my friend, said the captain of the liner.
"It is, my good sir, but how shall I know how to count?"
Outside the tower stood the black and red of the city; inside the tower lay the grey and grey of all the land.
The gray-haired woman dressed in red sat at the window.
How ironic was it that the most difficult thing in life became easier than it seemed?
The world is making a record.
It was a painting that began it all.
The sun was setting when Bronwyn traveled to the market.
When her parents must have been sleeping soundly, my sister Hilary had a passion for all things water-related, from swimming to pot-dancing. 
It was the night before Christmas, but the great need of the family was not only for the necessary materials for making a fire, but for a new toy.
The house was on a winding lane of the estate, a pleasant little cul-de-sac, twenty yards wide and fifteen yards long; its windows were a little box-like thing with a handle at either end, which at right angles gave the impression of a straight mirror, and the front door had a window-stall, which looked out upon an open garden; the front door had a window-stall and a French-style drawbridge, for the courtyards were all paved with yellow stone, and a broad canal ran through the house, carrying water and goods almost both ways; the garden, however, was quite large, and the houses all of a house-like size, as in most estates.

The sun rose over the desert of northern Jordan, setting the morning sky a note of golden tenor, and made it possible to see the red sand dunes of the nearby plains and mountain ranges, the white heat of the desert melting into the crimson blood-red sky.

Every morning, the aloft cargo elevator went for a pilot's walk west toward the harbor and into the open waters of the city of London.
The river flowed clean and clear through the woods of the north west; and from the banks of the river it seemed, on every side, the exception to the general rule, that some years back, whatever the prevailing climate of the region, some gigantic beast had appeared on the banks of that river as a human being; and, in reality, had been a human being; having been a man, and had been, or had been, of every human class; and had been, or had been, of every human race; and had been, or had been, of one or another kind of body; and had possessed more or less of two or three kinds of intelligence; and had been distinguished from his fellows by some characteristic qualities peculiar to the particular kind of river, or stream, or other watercourse, or channel, or channel by which it was obtained; and had been, or had been, however, the object of abhorrent or even loathsome detestable treatment; and had been, or had been, either tortured or executed for the crime of attempting to escape from the jurisdiction of any superior authority; had been, or had been, unwilling either to help the persecutors or to defend himself; had been, or had been willing to do anything to prevent his persecutors from killing, or setting out to kill, him; and had been, or at any rate, had believed himself to be, innocent; no less a judge or magistrate than a criminal had charged him.
The afternoon sun shone on the white sand of the beach, the water from the high, calm estuaries of the Ever-Water shone in some brilliant manner on the sand, and on the dark blue waters of the bay resembled a beautiful, if somewhat gaudy, city.
"You're gonna eat me," said the archangel as he lay down on the sand, "but don't kill me."
It is a pleasure to meet you, Ambassador Abbé.
The little town of Hetien was in a dire need of a new orphan, and for the guilty reason that its very life depended on the good conduct of a young boy, and for no less a reason, more than his mind, that magic had been required for the adoption of a child.

The girl with the pink dress stepped onto the roof's edge.
Rainbow Dash was sitting alone in the kitchen, staring at the ceiling.

Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
"We should probably get going before the rain begins, then."
Rarity sat on her hooves in the sun.
Rainbow Dash began to feel a bit dizzy.
Pinkie Pie peered down through the low ceiling of her office as though she had been watching a war for hours. 
Shhhhh!
Rainbow Dash leaned over the edge of the fountain and peered through the top cap, peering into the empty water with a kind of supreme wonder.
Rainbow Dash stared into the mirror of her flank pegasus.
The sun rose just before daybreak, and some ponies might have gotten used to it.
Twilight had had enough of telling her mother's story for a while now.
So this is the story of how I ended up living happily ever after and how I ended up with a dragon and a charming princess like you.
Rainbow Dash stood at the edge of the grass, watching the demigod vanish from the sky.
"Twilight is there. She's laughing her butt off."
They'd prepared for the worst.
"Rainbow Dash, come on."
Rainbow Dash had a bad feeling about this.
From the top of a high mountain, a high-spirited pony, naturally, waited for her sister.
Rainbow Dash was a lot of things, but most ponies didn't know just how kind she was.
Rainbow Dash reached the deep forests of the northeastern United States.
The sun finally reached its peak of the afternoon.
Tink, the Stone, that stick, didn't talk.
Rainbow Dash sat at her desk and watched as her sister leaned her head onto her shoulder.
Rainbow Dash peered into her book, half-listening, half-expecting her sister to speak.
Rainbow Dash thought that she'd be better off dead.
At first the clouds parted and the little valley of the Great Blue Hole appeared before them.
"I hope you are having a great day."
The clouds had parted and the little valley of the Great Blue Hole had appeared before them.
Rainbow Dash thought that she'd be better off dead.
Rainbow Dash, through the thickets of underbrush, through the smog, through the deep dark, lay in the dimness of her chambers, her head on her hooves.
Rainbow Dash had been thinking all day if she'd ever had the chance to speak to her sister again.
Rainbow Dash looked around her.
One evening I was sitting at the end of my summer vacation in the quaint town of Somerville, Massachusetts, when the idea of going to the city of Boston, a city of similar size, with a population of six million, came to my mind.
Pinkie peered into the camera.
Rainbow Dash, sitting behind the cover of Rarity's bedroom, her eyes riveted on the wide-angled porthole, was thinking about the stories she'd heard about the city, very similar to Boston.
The blue carpet had been cleaned just a few minutes ago, the dust flying in every direction, but the room still felt a little tattered.
Rarity had only two really good friends - the good old-fashioned Unbensky and the good old-fashioned Wiggon.
The sun rose at sunset, first as a gentle breeze that swept the leaves away, and then as a gust of cold air that whipped through the rooms of the little cottage that had stood in the middle of the flat, an empty space.
Rainbow Dash stood at the edge of the mare-drawn stream, watching as the water burst through the stone walls, the water pouring down into the river below.
Rainbow Dash stood on the edge of the blue water, watching as the waste-water drained away into the bay, the streams melting and the eels disappearing and the water stepping out of the bay into the deep waters of the bay.
A black cloud of vapour forms on the surface of the moon.
Draag walked out in front of the river with his back to it and his wings folded in his hands.
Rainbow Dash sat on her haunches, staring into the distance.
Rainbow Dash had the idea of giving the story a beginning.
Draag sat in the saddle and considered the plan he'd been given.
Rainbow Dash sat on her haunches, contemplating her drawing card.
Rainbow Dash stared at the floor, her eyes darting from one simple idea to another.
I went to the library this afternoon, and absentmindedly checked the title-page of the novel that I was reading. 
All right, here's my story: I live in a house on a hill. 
It was a strange thing to see, in those days when the sky was the only thing we knew, a celestial being travelling across a universe of stars.

The Eldest Prince had nothing to do with it,” he said.
Maud sat on the edge of the great grave, ignorant of all the history of the kingdom, and she had no intention of ever going back.

“Oh, f-f-fucks if I kill you now,” thought the young princess, wishing her father had not forbidden her to leave.
"You should have known better," said the general, as she stood on the edge of the granite threshold, "as a matter of course, you're here on trial, in the middle of a war, and you're not winning. You're not going to be able to keep it up all night."
The sun rose early, and warmth washed over the Mane Six, as if they were walking on water, inside the body of the river. 
Kaboom!
"The power is strong in the city, doesn't it? Are you sure you won't get caught?"
The first thing you learn in life is that you’re never exactly what you think.'
The first time I ever saw a cartoon, it just was me, running into the hall, running away, screaming, and running.

When Twilight froze in the doorway of her house, Chord the Pestilent came toward her.
"I thought you said if you're going to get a real job, you had better do it right."
Twilight had dreams, a thousand dreams.
At the time, Twilight was just about to head off to meet her father, who was still out in the swamp with his strong-arm brothers and were not going to let her leave until he had convinced her to do so.
Times have changed.
No matter the circumstances, it's always best to get up early and go to work, or to a bar, or to a murder mystery.
From one of the many turquoise brooks surrounding Ponyville, Sunnydale, and Appleloosa, swam a great white stallion with a rainbow flag in his hoof, two pink roses in one hoof.
The sky.
Twilight sighed heavily and slumped the shot glass.
If there's one thing the ponies of Equestria could use, it's everyone's help.
Pinkie Pie picked up a mug of light mop of tea and slid the lid down.
"Anthro?"
Rainbow Dash leaned back against the edge of the shallow pool and looked down.

The sun was starting to set on the farm where her farmhouse sat. 
She had been behind the wheel of the truck for nearly two hours and most of that time she didn't even care what the heck was happening around her.
Satellite watch.
She had been talking to myself all morning.
The clang of hooves against the tile door was the only sound in the factory.
She was sitting on the foot of a large tree in the shadow of an old oak tree, spreading her wings.
It was a good day, it was a dead day, but it was also a bad day for the Commonwealth of Marenden than it was for any other Australian state.
The mare trotted past the gate and the mare trotted past the gate a second time and higher, then a third, when the gleaming black stallion with the white head and the sharp nose and the white beard and the black tail and the smooth skinned face and the tail of a mare, that was Caen, turned suddenly towards the house.
No one knew what had become of the fair maiden, or why she had become lost.
The sun shone clear and the roiling breezes of the Pacific breeze blew the night air clean of the sweat, the blood, and the dust of the steppes.
Slow, steady, and thoughtful, the moment he took his seat at the table, Equestrians moved through the dark and the undulating hall of the palace, picking vixens and lasses out of the crowd and casting them away to dance with the three most beautiful sisters of the Siras Academy.
He sat on the porch of the blacktop condominium outside the city and reflected.
I have been watching this newscast ever since I learned to read.
I am a man, and a world-weary man, but I am not without a certain decency in me.
There are more than a few of us who enjoy a good yarn, and who like to be able to say that we were the author of some rare novel which one day the rest of mankind might be able to read.
He was taken in the morning, and had not time to lie down on the lawn.
I am a man.
A cold wind whipped through the air, churning the houses and the streets with a fine mist of powder and ash, and blowing snow and sleet and sleetpour in profusion.
The sun had set, but the rain had not yet stopped.
You have always been special to me.
The story of my life is a story of at least two steps.
In the year 1828, a young man named Albert Camus completed the arduous task of constructing, for posterity's sake, the standard work of modern art.
The mayor of a small town in a warm and fertile valley, where the air was neither too hot nor too cold, but the water at all seasons as just as it was in the olden days, gave a general barn-burn to the western part of the city.
It was in the year 1826 that living-room photographer Jules Ransom discovered the great painters.
The woman, the girl, who was known as the "Queen of the World" or at the most "Ass-Mother" was born to the rich and powerful of Paris, the daughter of a Frenchman, who was a great knight, but who was a mother of no particular prominence.
The day the city was to fall was clear at last.
The strange thing was that I didn't feel it.
The weather was still very fine, but the stars and moon were quite clear.
I was born in London in a house that some people called the "Palais-forge."
The forest was full of firs and had many a curious name: the "tree of firs," the "pine-tree of firs," the "bin of firs."
The first thing you know is that you've got a cold.
The morning after morn-day, Thomas the Great awoke with a start, and a sudden chill.
There was a small stream of water near Brindley.
"I've got a comet," he said to the sailors of the Thames.
When he was twelve years old, Angelo Littlefield invented the flotilla technique.
I have a pretty picture of the scene from my mind.
His eyeball was still open and his gaze was wandering, but he was sure there was something under the surface of the water.
"Here."
I was twenty-one years old when I met my mother, and I remember most of that time as if it happened yesterday.
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
"Twilight is in the kitchen, making the dinner."
Luna?
"Muuuuuldun!"
She's terrible!
Magic, goodness me!
Puck blinked.
In the dark, the night was filled with the soft sound of rain.
Everyone knew about time-turners, right?
Rainbow Dash and Trixie had been having a rough night at apple this year, though they both insisted that the trouble had nothing to do with the more fortunate Applejack.
Rainbow Dash has obviously been torn apart by grief.
The night was dark and stormy inside the Hall of Waters.
Spring and summer, always full of motion and sunshine.
The sunset light was soft on the sky.
"Moves like a stallion on horseback, doesn't it?"
The flatulent white dirt floor was three feet beneath their feet.
Twilight was watching over her hooves—a delicate balance, she reasoned, between worry and excitement—and Shining Armor was resting on her shoulder.
She was not the only Adventurer for whom the world of Equestria is all about friendship.
She had always wanted to be a goddess.
"Ask Miss Micah Scratch who was the first pony to depict the Hundred-Pony High Command."
It must have been close to sundown at the end of a strong evening of dancing and singing, when the streets of Ponyville seemed to be suddenly hissing with the sound of hooves pounding on metal doors.
It took ten years for Rainbow Dash to realize what she was really up to, but she knew exactly what she needed to do.
It was a stormy night in the desert.
In the year 6, on the second day of August, the oldest city of the peaceful Republic of Isen knew that she had reached the end of her line of life.
My name is Equestrian, and I am writing this letter in the presence of the highest authorities of my nation and my race.
Twilight couldn't bear to end her story without telling her of the man who had saved her life and placed her in the care of her only friend, Applejack.
"Who washed the car?" Applejack asked.
"Applejack," the pony said.
"Apple?" Applejack asked.
They wouldn't have it any other way, would they?
The sun cast an eerie violet glow through the desert.
The sun slowly rose over the twilight grayness of the foothills of the Rocky Range.
The lake was silent, save for the conversation of the petrels, and seemed to go on indefinitely.
The sky was grey and grey; the water was clear as crystal.
The sand slicked by the light of the dying sun, it was light enough to see a thin line of pink between the moon and the stars.
The town of Diamond Head was a rough, old-fashioned place, with one very old, very cracked house on a piece of dirt.
What a terrible thing it is for a man to be dead.
I do not know where I came from, but I am now forty-five, and I am a queer fellow, very queer indeed!
Applejack's world was on fire, and she did not know it, but she knew it was the end.
In the corner of the barn was a pile of guncotton balls.
I am going to write a magenta story about an apple.
It was a cold, dark, windy October morning that the Land Surfing Administration at Port City, California, first found out about the novel, known to its visitors and subscribers as "The Crown of Sand."
There was a girl named Olive Merida who had been born on a train.
It is a cold, dark, windy October morning, and yet the Milky Way is visible, stars streaming over the Southern Ocean.
It is a crime, if ever there had been one, to omit to mention the name of the author; and this crime is not only extremely dangerous, but in the worst cases extraordinarily ignominious, and for the most part impossible to prevent.
The crowd standing on the street corner in front of the small, narrow apartment, where the young people slept, was made up of a few exactly alike characters; but they all knew that they were all party to a great secret, and that no innocent man was ever to be prosecuted for a crime which he had not committed himself.
It was a cold, dark, windy October morning, when a town horse sprang up on the roadside outside the fort.
The sun shone warmly on the blackened earth of the Blackwater.
It was a cold, dark, windy October morning, when the town of Grand Rapids, Michigan, first noticed a strange figure roaming about.
There was once a poor farmer in a small town, who lived in a house, or

The Thirteen Elements – an institution of magic – stood tall.
The night Celestia took a relief trip to the Crystal Empire, the world was shaken to its foundations.
It was the middle of the night: the first light of the day.
The moon was blazing bright against the crystal sea of stars, and the calm blue water of the river Tiai offered no cover.
"A pale pink, five-hundred and thirty-six millionths of a second after midnight, won't do."
"What are those?"
"A child with a brain the size of a sphinx."
"No one has ever been able to determine the reason why the sky is covered with brilliant white passing through a gray, tawny-colored milky sky."
“I “m going to be late for the appointment,” the first thing I said when I saw the man standing in the doorway.
My name is Eardius Daisuk.
The dead were always there.
I was born in the year 1312 – the year that my parents perished.
The two horses sat on their haunches close to the ground, but there was not a single rock to be seen.
It was the largest space station ever constructed.
I am, of course, speaking of this one.
At first sight it appeared to be the most ordinary of emporia.
The stars, in that age when they were compared by their neighbors with the sizes of diamonds, 610 feet across and all, the width of a man's arm, as they now appear to the eye, were exceedingly beautiful.
The sun was sinking in the east when a large, pale-gray cat appeared from behind the trees and the summit of a mountain.
The universe is upset.
There was once a world, a world perfectly normal.
When the first ship started its voyage to the new world of the North at the head of the stars, it was filled with the cheer of its captain, the joy of her crew, and the hope of the vast riches that lay in store for her.
The city of San D) was a most picturesque and lovely place.
The sun rose as late as the sun rises in the old world.
I stood before the door of the dead man's room.
The clocks stand still again.
It was a Sunday when the boy who grew to three feet six inches slipped from the shadow of the street corner into his favourite park.
It was a cloudy and rainy morning in August.
I am writing this on a bench in my garden, with the view of the water from which I draw water for my horses.
Scheduled for 6:05 on a Sunday, the final stage of final dress rehearsals for the pop group, The Library, had begun when the chorus, looking drowsy, began to sing the song 'Twenty-Eighth Century, By John the Revelator, Of the Town of Perche', which is to say: Oh, I had it all planned for, was all there was to it.
I stand before the chamber door of the prison cell which I now call the cell of feelings.
In search of all the things that are not us,
I soon discovered that the world was much larger than I ever expected.
I am sitting in my library of imaginary perceptions, reading a book by H.P. Lovecraft, when the thought occurs to me that it would be a good idea to write this story about a writer who lived some years ago, sometime between the years of 1880 and 1925.
The end of the world is not great, and yet there are many of us who believe, or pretend to believe, that it is entirely without cause.
It was a cold, snow-less day in April, when the thin violets of summer rose, and fell on the grey plain of the Sault, a snowflaking sheet which hung in the air like a record, a relic of the winter of 1871, or perhaps more.
The tiny building which housed the College of Swindon, and which later became known as the Sorbonne, had been built in the first half of the twelfth century.
The moon was not far behind him in the arch of the palace.
It began, as we have said, with a question.
Manton discovered the existence of the world in a paper which was stuck on the back of his desk, and which he picked up and read from time to time.
It was about ten o'clock in the afternoon of the date I have just mentioned when the youngest brother of the Princess of the House of Halsmere, Mary de Lange, married the eldest daughter of the Earl of St. James; and this marriage came to naught but the loss of all the daughters of the same family, and the loss of their grandmother.
I am an old man
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes. A perpetual blush covered her cheeks.
There were six of us.
6:31 PM They found him.
No.
The Forest of the Dead grew tall and green.
The sound of a distant clatter could be heard through the night.
EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER KNOWN, EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER EVEN THINKED ABOUT, IS JUST GONNA HAPPEN, VERY, VERY, VERY soon.
There was a story about a certain unicorn that had the largest horn of any unicorn in the west, the longest and the widest, all the way up to the horns of the yellow and black chalcedony.
The late summer air was crisp, slightly hot and slightly bitter.
The song was a raspy, purr.
The sun was bathed in slush of the lake at the edge of the desert.
"I like her dress."
Rain had come fast as a mare. 
I had come to discover that there were limits to the breadth of imagination.
"When is the end of the world?"
Nine things about the institution of marriage suggested to me that it was a dead end.
The sun sat on its apex and its smooth black slopes in a land of full greenness, with the summer air of a land of promise and promise's bustle and its promise, the promise of the stars and the promise of the earth itself, a land where there was no sin and no hate nor any fear, where there was no man's fault and no man's fault's fault, where there was no bad behavior nor any bad habit nor any bad character, where there was no evil in the eyes of God, where there was no evil that should escape him, nor any evil that should escape him, nor any evil or bad spirit, no Lord, no God, no God nor any spirit, near him or in his name, or any thing that is not in him.
To our knowledge, no authority on the subject has ever before referred to the natural course of things or the laws that govern them as the "laws of nature."
There was once a well known seer of old who lived a long and happy life.
He was a colossal, towering being of great stature and of long and deep arms, whose mind, though so small, was so vast that it required a large staff to carry it around.
It was not long ago that all the pieces of the Necron back story were falling into place.
"There is no sun, there is no moon, there is neither wind nor rain," said the astronomer Becton, under all sorts of circumstances.
It was with great anxiety that I waited for the world to end. 
"One day I shall get to the realisation that over all the whole of the habitable universe, if you begin with the smallest particle there, in the direction of the centre of the earth, you will find everywhere a large body of water, all round about, in which there is no land."
Weeeeellllllllloooooooooooool.
It was a beautiful day, and the weather was fine.
There are only three people in the world: myself, my wife Julia and my dog, Giggle in the front seat.
It is always best to start at the beginning. 
It was the autumn of 1824, and the year was still fresh.
There was once a fairly famous lady of the town, in whom all manner of interests were alike.
I have been reading thus far the narrative of the story told, and I am afraid I am in danger of concluding that my reader has been induced by his observations to believe the whole tale.
I was a boy of ten or eleven years old when I first met the gentleman who was to become my friend.
I do not remember the date on which I became acquainted with the great great disinterested man, called the Earl, or Lord Stokes.

How far did the Moon go across the sky?
The space of nineteen hundred and twenty-two million miles beyond the solar system is called the "outermost" or the "outermost star."
It was a bright summer day in July, and a solitary star stood red and threadbare in the sky above the coast of the French island of La Rochelle, in the midst of the Mediterranean Sea.

Dust off the mare, Oh In-fact-it's-time-to-get-the-recessive out of your hair! It's time for you and us both to talk.
You're not the only pony that I have a crush on.
The clouds parted, and the sun once more watched the land as it was.
The land was lush and green, and they called it the City.
The humming hoof hummed through the quiet, dark tunnels of the undercity.
Fluttershy sat down on the back of the dragon, and looked up into the sky.
It was a rainy day, and the grass was dying.
Two ponies lay in the shade of a pile of bricks, their eyes watching the distant city.
Rain had come early, but the air stilled and the wind howled.
Today we have another hour of detention.
Part of my job in life is to do the impossible.
It was the night before the court martial that I discovered my sister was pregnant.
How many times have you heard the phrase, "There's a sea in the deep, and she ain't going nowhere."
Art by the beautiful and talented Megastible, the one and only Outland.
A gust of wind howled, the sound of a night owl, and a swan flew low, out of sight and into the distance.
The neon lights of the area's busiest intersection pulsated to life.
The air was thick with a perpetual low hum of wind.
A thick fog hung in the blackness above Laketo Tower, the lowest point on a mountain pass of many peaks and a valley, but mostly, a valley of peaks.
The library was like a dream.
The small, alabaster room was lit only by the flickering light of small lamps which shone on a single white wall.
The air was cold and faint, as though it had never been there in the first place.
I'd been worried.
Part of me wished I knew how to start a conversation.
The city was big, and the streets were all black, and so were the buildings that faced it, and the homes in those houses, all of which had curtains to protect their occupants.
I was born in the year of twelfth-century Beda, but that doesn't mean I can't tell a story.
When the sun was out, the good old Thames was a peaceful, quiet place.
There was once a town in England called Liverpool, where, after a major war, the waters which now form the mouth of the river were taken by the victors, and their favourite cities were such as that there were still for many years after the battle, and for many years, no doubt, the town was called Liverpool.
There was once a town in a country called Texas, which was called Linn county, and which had been known to most people in the country as the city of Linn.
There was once a town in the province of the Muhanart, which was called Linn, and which had been known to the most powerful men and the most powerful women of the time, as given in the history of that province, but which had been in many cases unknown to the general public, and which was, alone, but in the opinion of all the most eminent men in the province, the most respectable and alluring of all the places in the province, and of all the ordinary parts of the province, in the province of the Muhanart, because it was well known to all the ladies and most fashionable of the people, and in addition, because it was of the most respectable and most fashionable character, and because the fashionable ladies had in the last judgment of the time, and had in consequence extirpated all other pecuniary advantages from their every disposition and all other circumstance, but only to the greatest advantage of themselves; and, since they had so great a profit to make from the sale of the city, it was only proper that they should have the greatest care in these things, because, as all gravitate towards the centre, and as all are disposed towards the same end, and because there is in most countries before the second half of the last century, at least, a diminution of the size of the city, and a supply of men, who are usually called citizens, in comparison with that of the other provinces, which is usually considerably greater and more numerous; and as some of the largest cities of the country were, for a long time after, in a state of decay and in a remarkably amiable condition, these cities, which had become considerably larger and more populous, in consequence of the continual change of circumstances of land and people, were, and are, generally little more than large towns, or small cities, and were generally of very doubtful character.
It was never this hot in the summer time, never this
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
Seriously, Twilight. It's hard enough to care, but it's even harder to do it right.
The platinum-blond-haired alicorn had spent the day trying to convince her friend to let her ride to the Everfree.
Shirley, is still here, in a hospital bed.
"Well, well, that did not go as planned!"
Serene white clouds whirled in the face of the ice-blue sky as the gentle storm picked up and swirled and churned in the midst of a vast, clear river, its white runners winding their way along the frozen water and their bright mottled green chubbings framing the great river's black waters.
Not a bad start to a very hot and thirsty summer.
It was the start of the year, and the swan was singing at the window.
Twilight smiled as she watched her father wash his hands in the sink, then rise to the counter and give Applejack a knowing nod.
Rainadore sat at the table, waiting.
Rainbow Dash sat down on the edge of the desk, and looked around for her friends.
Rainbow Dash stood there for a moment, looking at the sky, then up at the ceiling.
Rainbow Dash sat and watched the rain, knowing her friends would be there to help her.
"Applejack Dash, what's wrong with you?"
Rainbow Dash was quietly trying to get to her feet when she heard a sharp screech.
Rainbow Dash sat down on the top of the tower.
Rainbow Dash sat down on the edge of the wall.
Rainbow Dash sat down on the ground.
Rainbow Dash stood on the edge of the top of a hill and watched over everything, allowing herself to be swept up in the sheer weight of reality.
Rainbow Dash frowned at the grey, black clouds gathering in the sky.
Pinkie stopped and stared up at the crystal ball in the sky, bowing low and reaching out to grasp it.
Rainbow Dash sat on the top of her hooves on the ground, her tail turning to one side and her eyes closed.
Rainbow Dash sat by her friends, watching them, and looking around her.
Rainbow Dash leaned against the tree, her eyes closed and her mouth hanging open.
Rainbow Dash sat down on the side of the tree, her leg dangling past the tip.
Rainbow Dash sat on the ground as the rain began to fall, feeling the thuds of the water hitting her back and neck.
Rainbow Dash stood there in the cold, trying to think of anything to do.
Rainbow Dash sat on the bank, her hooves carefully below the surface of the water, her flat chest and shy muzzle showing the attention of the natural beauty.
Rainbow Dash stepped carefully down the steps of her trailer, her eyes resting on the blackened metal.
Rainbow Dash fell for the first time in her life, falling for the man who was never going to do anything for her.
Rainbow Dash walked toward the door.
Rainbow Dash bounced down from the roof of the trailer, dodging the continuing rain from the northwest.
Rainbow Dash sat on the ground, her eyes closed and her wings flapping free.
Rainbow stare throughout the forest outside Ponyville.
Rainbow Dash trotted briskly through the dark, wary of the scent of the blood.

Rainbow Dash stood there, her hooves resting on the ground.
Rainbow Dash sat on the ground, her hooves resting in front of her.
Rainbow Dash watched as the sun rose over the faraway mountains.
Rainbow Dash sighed as she watched her friends ride into the forest.
Rainbow Dash rode silently toward her cabin, her eyes half-closed and her mind racing in its mind's eye.
Rainbow Dash sat atop the grand tower, watching the morning sun shine onto the smooth snow-packed floor of the castle.
The great manor stood tall, its towers towering over the city of Canterlot.
Rainbow Dash stood atop the plateau, her hooves on the ground.
Rainbow Dash stood at the edge of the rocky pinnacle, her hooves glinting in the morning sunlight.
Rainbow Dash stood on the edge of a cliff.
The clouds rolled, their bright blue tops reflecting the brilliant white rays that filtered through the shimmering pools below.
Rainbow Dash looked up at the faint moon overhead.
It was a dull, grey day in the summer of 1994, and a group of friends came to visit the elderly and mentally ill neighbor of their house.
It had been a rather long day.
In the year which is to come I shall write down the

Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
"Hello, my name is Pinkie Pie, and I have a plan for the future. Don't worry, I will tell you everything, because no one else can."
"Applejack, are you okay?"
Rainbow Dash was going to show up at the party with the result of a large, enormous case of emeralds that had taken hours to dredge out of the depths of the ocean.
"Is it just me, or do the clouds look like they're getting closer?"
"Applejack, are you up or down?"
"Pinkie Pie! I just had my whole branch cut down and the one in my paw is still bleeding. It was such a glorious sight."
"Twilight, what do you think you're doing?"
"You look like you need a lift home."
"Who is that?"
"What are you doing here?"
"...Darkness, before the start of the summer. Dark"
...yup.
I had the good fortune of being born in the summer, although my father and mother and I both know that there is another side to the earth, away from the serene, beautiful shores of the Pacific.
The garden was beautiful, and I suppose that it was the weather, but that was the only thing that was actually different.
"You know what they say about sunshine in the west, don't you?"
This is the story of how my sister was born, and how it all came to an end.
I cannot decide whether it is good that I should listen to my mother tell me a story, or whether I am to be contented with the facts that I have.
My name is Rose Bamber, and I have been praying to the Lady of the House of War for some time now, to obtain a copy of her Book of Hours, to which I shall be most cordially indebted for the information which has been contained in it.
"You've got to be kidding me!"
"I know they call me the Princess, but I should like to be called the Queen of the Desert."
Pinkie Pie had been married to Applejack for several weeks when she heard that Twilight was expecting a baby.
Twilight, who was riding in her hoof the morning she lost her virginity, was in her bedroom, writing a letter to her mother.
The sun came up early in the morning and when it finally did she could feel the heat going down on the concrete.
"So, what's the plan on the diamond market?" Applejack asked as she gazed out at the street.
The morning sun shone brightly in the town.
"Hey, you should watch it, Tuff, it's really interesting."
"A/N, this was supposed to be a story about a princess, but the Princess, once she had her soul back, decided that she did not want to be a princess any longer, and so she is now known as The Princess of the Desert."
Carpenter Smithers walked slowly up the winding stone stairs to the head of the grand staircase.
Twilight brought her half-eaten apple and sat on her haunches and opened her eyes.
The top of the valley was much higher than the rest of the valley.
The sun shone bright in Ponyville, crossing over the trees of the trees of the world and into the city.
The sun shone so brightly for so long, you could see the stars all around as if they were there.
When Celestia had finally strangled the Silursi Empire and all its assholes, she had built the capital city of the empire.
''Ring the bells, I've got some urgent business to attend to.''
In the North Delta, at the centre of the great Cornucopia, there was a city of potters called the Cornouse.
The sun was shining bright in the sky, singing in the middle of the night wind from a sea of blue sky.
Before the days of old, when the earth was still small and the sea large and the sky grey and cold and the sea was a river and the earth was a flat blanket of water and the sky was a clear blue and the stars were coloured grey, there was an island.
The waters of the Gulf of Mexico lay calm, calm enough to lie as it did on the ocean's bottom and yet it was not so soft and dry that it required no shelter from the wind or rain, ill-tempered by the hardness of its rock or by the strength of its waves.
Twilight Sparkle woke up with a start and...
Eyes adjusted, the pony hoof moved carefully, aiming for the sky.
The world was empty when Equestria's first Princess Celestia was born.
When the sun began to set over Utopia's low-lying island of Uticum and the summer plums and the occasional prune or pear appeared in
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
It had started out one night in the spring of a year long ago.
She was always the one to pick the lock on the front door.
Rainbow Dash's childhood was so full of magic and wonder that it was almost impossible to remember all of it.
The weather was hot and humid.
I am a stallion of the Royal British Legion.
Rainbow Dash sat atop the clouds on her hooves.
This is where the sacred door of the Crystal Empire is.
My name is the foremost expert on the subject of eye-contact magic.
On the morning of the day Twilight doesn't give a flying fuck about what kingdom her ancestors ruled, she starts the morning of the day Twilight never gives a flying fuck about what kingdom her ancestors ruled.
Twilight sat up in bed.
The ground was polished and round but all the same, it was still rough, rough enough to cause a crash if you rolled over and didn't know what hit you, rough enough to jam your hundred-pound foreleg into your ninety-pound back with the force of a cannonball.
One sunny morning in Eighteen days, my uncle, my cousin, and I rescued twenty-six pony children who were lost or had perished in the savage wilderness of Northern Indiana.
How do you make a friend, Twilight?
It was the day Twilight's sister, Applejack, died, yet she was feeling very much alive.
Twilight stood up and brushed her bangs off her head.
Twilight's mother had a hobby, one that she thought was amusing.
Twilight looked around at the other ponies on the grounds and, after a few moments' thought, decided that she preferred the company of the solid, rather than anything that flopped like the usual soft little things that other ponies had.
Rainbow Dash had been waiting all morning for the important piece of paperwork that was going to give her father his retroactive pardon.
Twilight was just finishing up the last of the cupcakes and had nearly finished her breakfast when she heard the door open.
It was a Black and Mildewy day, but at least it didn't have a story to tell and the sun shone brightly in the summer heat of Gravity Falls, as it always did in summer.
It was a cold and wet and snowy day, with snow all around.
Rainbow Dash had always known that she had a lot of talent.
I put up with the fact that there was no sun for days at a time, and that every evening was spent in dressing and grooming, which had been my sole occupation ever since I had been sixteen.
It was a beautiful day in the summer of Seventeen, a day which many people would say was one of the best in the whole year.
It was a beautiful day in the summer of Seventeen, a day which many people would say was one of the best in the whole year.
Rainbow Dash slipped into the dining room of her house on the grounds of a fort in an ancient permanent habitation, and sat down to dinner on a large, white-walled low table.
It was a hot, sticky, dusty, snow-streaked day in June of the first year of the reign of the last sovereign of the Hebrews, Maron, when it happened that lavishly decorated in gold-and-blue and lacquered with silver and carved with precious stones, the tomb of Archangel Michael, with its rich burial vault, of a King and Queen, whose names were Arahm, Elihu, and his wife Elihu, the name of whom is not mentioned, but the title of which is "Emperor of the City," was discovered in the place of a tomb, and an inscription on the tomb was:
Your Majesty, it has come to pass in heaven, that there is a certain man, called Albert, who, although he be of ancient age, yet he is of a sound mind; he can well remember what events have taken place in history.
Rainbow Dash, Princess Twilight Sparkle, Princess Cadence's foster sister, had a dream.
It was a sunny, warm day in the third year of what was called the reign of the last sovereign of the Hebrews, of whom I shall speak in a moment.
Rainbow Dash, Princess Twilight Sparkle, Princess Equestrian found herself standing alone in the middle of the room, among the eyes of six magnificent, beautiful ponies, who were all dressed in pink and red and gold and green, and who were gazing in as pleasantly a manner as if they had just purchased a new wardrobe.
Rainbow Dash sat down on the bench and peered into the red and gold plate-glass.
Eyes closed, finger tips outstretched, Dash shifted her gaze from the stack of paperwork to a passing stallion in the distance.
My name is Don, and this is my story.
My father paid a
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
This is when I realised that there was a world beyond the stars...
But there was a difference between a good book and a great one.
I said to Celestia that I would come back for you when I could no longer stay--but first I had to get the books!
The valley is yellow with the dead of winter, the sun is black as lead, and the river is frozen solid.
There are two ways to get to the center of the universe.
Ponytail was a very weird little pony, very little--but through no fault of her own did she ever know it.
It was the first Saturday in July and there was no rain; but the sun shone like a lamp under the trees all day long, and the clouds were as bright as the sun itself.
He had always been afraid of the dark.
First the twig-shrouded thorns, then the thorny gray of the old growths, and on to the flowering plants, tipped with silver and red-violet flowers, branching like twigs into a grand, flowing bonsai.
The room was dark and cold, like the East — the great city that never sleeps.
Yes, it's a beast, it will tear you limb from limb, it will devour you in one instant.
This is about as close as you are likely to come to a real-life story of Princess Celestion. 
I am still standing there, watching the clouds.
The sun rose slowly, the sky opening and ending beneath it like a chimaera that burst in all directions.
When the day was over and the rain had ceased, James, Princess Sera of the Shining Crowns of the royal family, sat down at her breakfast table in her palace at the centre of the seaside and lit a match and put it right between the curtains and the headboard.
I stood in the doorway of the train station with my back to the shimmering green mist, keeping my head down so as not to stir.
The window of the wing of an airship lit up with the light of fireflies, and the wind howled high above, a mark of the sublime. 
It was the day and the hour of temptation.
It all began in an empty house at the end of a block of flats, and a man named Peter was having none of it. 
He was born in London in the last year of the war, in a comfortable home close by the Wharf, in the end of the great race of bright, shining people.
Sir, I say, the matter is settled. I have given you all enough information for the present.
The first time he let out a long whiny howl, the servant woke up the neighbor who lived in the house next door to his.
I am not sure that the subject has ever been considered of any importance, and it is only because I am of an age to know.
I had a great dream.
The door of the old man's house swung open, and the old man entered. 
The road hissed blood through the junipers, and the tail of the blackbird, lance-tailed, flew high above his head.
When the sun rose that morning, the moon rose high over the bright orange and green hills, and the sky above them was a shining vessel, sparkling with stars and streaks of moonlight.
Waking on all fours, holding onto the edge of a precipice, Princess Minnie on the limp cobblestones of the streets of Canterlot.
Gadgetrons and dragon servants at the west gate of the palace had come to fetch their usual morning makings. 
It is the first full moon of the month of May—a period of mild sunshine, and which I have already described to you, by way of example.
The house was wide and lofty, with tall pillars and arched doors.
The room with the slanting roof and a single window faced west, and the great, dark house seemed to be moving slowly westward, as if it were going through a warp of time.
The sun shone, and the moon shone, and though the streets of Canterlot were pretty and cheerful, there were many things which they liked best of all.
The Ponies of Equestria had truly reached a great age.
"I've been thinking about this all morning, darling," said the flash of light that heralded the beginning of the day.
The wind howled, and the houses of Equestria, in all their splendor, felt a little more like the place where you and I live—which was to say, a little less grand.
"Where do you think the skies are?" asked Pinkie Pie.
The winds of winter blew across the grasslands and windmills of Equestria.
The water was not as white as
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes. It was a strange day, like almost every day in the past few months, though it was just as strange on four threes as it had been in the other one. She was trying to remember what it had been like to go through a fresh, ridiculous crisis of adult existence.
Rain came from the sky as if he had been pulled out of the deep dark, and his shoes and coat clattered on the wet asphalt below.
The wind howled.
*** FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE PRESENT HOUR, ONE OF THE CORPS of The Terminal as a whole asked me to come and talk to them. NEARLY THE LAST DAY OF THE year, THE TIME WARM WITH ANTI-HIGH HEAT OF SEX, when a most pregnant aspect of humanity was experiencing its processes of undevelopment, when it was becoming conscious of its own vulnerability, it assembled on the Dockside of London. It was a scene which some people have been accustomed to see when they have supposed that the subject is always the same. There was no doubt whatever that the problem of London was approaching a climax. The Charing Cross Station, in the morning, was crowded with people, but was, as usual, silent, and as it were half-doomed. In the afternoon, the station was still, but people were not. There was a certain air of vagueness about all the stations, but the truth of the matter was that there was near-nothing to do but go along and wait. In the evening, when the streets of London were far quieter, the traffic was more orderly and the streets, which had been a ruinous wreck, seemed to have become picturesque. There were still pedestrians in the Market and, although it was still not very lively, at least the feeling of the street was not as if it had been wrecked. The growth of the Royal Inns of Court, however, had at length brought about a change in the mood of the city. The giant, vast structure, which had appeared for a few days in the summer of 1876, was a marvel of opulence, and in the estimation of every intelligent person. The interior of the mansion was as neat and neat as one would expect from one of the prominent houses of the city. There were windows in every wall of every room, and at the front of the house the large parlor was a conspicuous and ample feature. On each of the four towers which borne the black-cloaked monarch, there were apartments for Princess Elizabeth in which she could spend the night; and further down, looking down at the river, there was another apartment which was occupied by her. The entire story has been told in my own imagination, but the details which I have given will serve for your guidance. When you come to it, your discovery will be complete. Never was there anything so curious in the business of life. I am making this story for the purpose of giving an account of what I have experienced during a few weeks' stay in the city of London, and by way of telling what is passing in the province, but not without some thought into what may happen in the future. Having come to the point where I may be useful to others, I shall, I trust, try to do better than get into any details which may not be pertinent to the subject at all. All that has been told of such an object as the Tower of London is the consequence of a study made during the winter of 1876, by myself and a few of my friends, which was carried out during the summer, when the market was in full course of improvement. The spring of that year was a bright and acrimonious one. My friend and companion in the matter of business, Thomas A. Thurston, of South London, was born in the year 1794 of a good family. My paternal grandfather, Mr. William Thurston, was a famous partner in the famous Baker's Post in London, and was so famous that he was dismissed from the post for letting his wife and daughter run away with a large sum of money, and died before he came to court. My father was born in the year 1779, and of a good family. My father, Mr. William Wellington, of a good family, was a ship-builder, and, at a period when it was not uncommon, had acquired a reputation for industry and daring, especially with the British navy, which in those days was second to none. My grandfather had at that time a large family, both brothers and sisters, all of whom were well known in the neighbourhood; and noticed, when his friend, Mr. Alexander Unwin, was at court, that the name of his mother was already well known in that place. My father was a tall, strong man, with an imposing, powerful frame. On my father's side, instead of fifty rungs or so, he stood at the top of the court, and looked down into the

I am not a thief, but I have been caught.
Another day, another trot of the swan, another utter waste of time. 
"The worm, I suppose?"
The past is a strange place.
I am an empty shell, a shell of an idea, a shell of a thought.
At first, the moon didn't move, nor did the stars for a while.
The sky was blue and the water was calm, as if a traveler had never been there before.
This is the story of the life and death of a poor little town.
At first they thought it was a dream.
I was born to die.
I didn't know it at the time, but you had to be there to hear the story of what happened when you did.
The moon started to swing close in front of the mountain peak, and then it stopped.
On the night he fell to his death, Peter did not dream that he was going to die.
Where are the PCs?
I glance down, sigh. 
The wind howls in the windless wilderness, but the men of the mountain retain their faith in the Lord of the Sea. 
The wind howls, and clanks heavily against the steep bark against the north.
I've been on a journey, to be precise, ever since I was a child of ten years old and cut my hair short so as to be able to edgewise it better. 
The sea is beautiful, and the sky is blue-eyed.
The steel doors of the City-Ship slid open and a tall, slim man stepped out, his left arm crossed over his chest, as though he were about to slide into oblivion.
The fog lifted from the sea, revealing the pale city of Cresse, with its higher towers, and its towers and its spires and its vastness and its isolation and its grandeur and its great hall and its great hall, the great hall of the red-gold, and the great hall of the white-gold, and the great hall of the blue-gold which is one and the same, and half-built, and made of white stone and granite, and partly of red, partly of blue-gold, and covered with a thick black-wood mat of sea-green marble and with a roof of black-wood, and partly of blue-wood, and partly of pink-petal, and partly of purple-petal, and covered with tall black cypress-trees.
This is the story of my father, and of my mother, and of my sister and my brother, and of my sister and me, and of my sister's brother, and of my brother and my brother's sister.
The sun had not yet set when the strange figure emerged from the darkness and apparated before the house.
The battles were always the same.
I was born when the universe began.
It was fifteen years old and I was sitting at my desk in my office reading an encyclopedia when I dreamed that I was in the presence of the greatest creation.
The moon moved through the blackness of space, and the stars that lay beyond the horizon looked up at the reflected moon, and said to themselves: 'It is beautiful.'
The air was thick with the smell of the sea, and cold, and salty with the dampness of the rivulets.
The sun rose to give a full moon a full face and bright eyes, and a gleaming white mane of white-bearded hair.
In the midst of the darkness of the night, the shadows of the little flowers played their dark and sad tune on the branches of a gentle tree.
In a lonely little village, very far away from the main towns and even the great cities of England, nestled in the midst of a forest, there lived a small family, who had lived until long after the end of the world.
The world on which we live is a beautiful world indeed, but it is not the world which the great majority of our ancestors would have chosen to live in if they had had the chance to choose.
Is that all I'll say about the story?
He had never been happier.
I had been prayed into oblivion; until my mother took me to meet a certain bloke in a changing room who had been dead for a very long time.
I was born in a time of evil, and it almost killed me; but I was lucky enough to be spared.
In Beta, usually at the beginning of the month, there was a light spring in the air and a great breeze in the sky.
The sun was shining brightly behind the curtain.
He had only days to live.
It wouldn't be long before the sun would be dead.
The moon was shining brightly through the long dark of the night in the late autumn, and as

At one point, only eleven forty four hours ago, she was playing with a vermin on a dark and stormy night in the park, in the heart of the city of Manehattan.
"It's a shame now that you're in trouble."
It was a golden summer's day, but the skies were clear and the air crisp and the sun shone bright.
A darke, or large quakish bird, is a bird of enormous size and dull gray plumage that is similar in appearance to the dun-feathers and carrion birds of higher genera, but which is much larger, longer, and broader in proportion, and has a silver-blue body and a silver-black beak.
Some days I like to play with a special chair on the floor which I get up on and put on my head and prop myself up on by leaning against a wall of the room, and just lay down there and roll around, while I have a view of the world.
That's not how it works, but it does, in a way, pretty well, from my point of view.
The first time he had a dream, it was the morning after his mother had died of ovarian cancer and, the night before, he had spent the night in a hospital room with a needle in his arm and a tube in his leg.
The volume moved slowly; only a person with vision would have imagined that it could move with such unstoppable speed.
Ten-year-old me and a fourteen-year-old girl.
She was waiting for me at the doorway.
The sun was burning, and it had been five hours since the last thing I had done, or thought about doing, did anything but turn me into a horrid thing like that.
I had read some of the reports all over the Internet about how the characters in Great is the Kingdom of God.
Two men, in a dark room in a catacomb, had made a pot of gold.
No one knows why the world is evil; many think it was because the gods wanted to destroy it, or that they had an evil plot.
Water was the one thing that did not belong to the supernatural.
I'm going to tell you one of the real reasons why the world is so windy and sick and miserable.
It was the middle of summer, the first snowfall of the north.
Nobody questioned the gods, couldn't really get over what they were doing.
The old man walked slowly along the banks of the Pumbul river.
With a broken mirror and a different look in his eyes, Sir Francis Galen regarded the black-robed figures in the distance, who made the most of the clear blue sky by scattering their light over the vast expanse of land.
All the fairies in the world wrote happy messages to the prince.
There was a little thicket of oak trees growing up out of the flat and damp earth.
I stood on the top of the kindling and watched as the woodfire danced and the flames of a maple sycamore tower danced in the night sky above.
The forest was white as a sheet, with the grass green and the thistles bare and the trees as if they had never been broken in the first place.
The old woman's name was Professor Glaise Wickramin.
I stood in the garden, listening to the rustle of the leaves and the soft clatter of the rain as I watched the sprinklers.
"The day your Mum and Dad died, you should have been up."
"I don't know how else to put this but I'm pregnant."
It was my first encounter with the moon.
The world was empty and cold.
The zoomorphin was the only thing keeping me sane.
The sun was setting and the sky was full of smaller stars instead of the big ones we usually see.
My name is James.

It was the night when the curtain of the theater let out a sound that shook the foundations of the houses that were standing around.
Twelve people sit in the Senate of the Republic, with their names written simply on the outer door, and the consequence of their votes is expressed by the impression which we make of the upper house when we come down from the upper gallery of the gallery.
Certainly, no one would have a mind exactly in the same state if he had not been born into it.

"That bonnie little trombonist is always smiling," said Celestia.
"I have a proposition for you, Senior Minister," said the woman in the back of the room.
The moon is breathtaking.
The first time I saw the sun go down, I thought the world was going to end.
Coraline drove down the main drag toward the nearest ocean liner.
I dreamt I was going to die.
"Mate, please don't kill me."
"My name is Doreen. I'm a princess."
"I knew you'd come along, Mr. Thirsk."
Tara flung her eye around the room, trying to find her way out of the living room.
The world is dying.
There were three of us, two boys and a girl.
My brother Travin said he was going to steal my twin sisters, but I thought he was joking.
I am writing this letter in my library at home, at the foot of a little tree, with a certain proportion of air which might be used to stand up from a sitting position, and other furniture which I am not accustomed to consider important, especially when it comes to the grades of library books.
This is the story of me and you, the story of you and me, and I write it for you, because I am sure that you will find it interesting.
My life changed on one day in August in 1884, when I saw the start of the war.
The night was not nice, for the airships were gone, and it was cold and snowy and blizzard.
My uncle was an honest man, and a good law-abiding man.
The wounded were still pouring through the gate into the ship, and the dead were still dragging out of the city, some lying prostrate on the deck, others already dead.
How many years I have been dead, and how many other living beings have been affected by this apocalypse!
I lived in a house on the highest floor of a well-to-do walled-up building in Ninth Street, which was at one time the most fashionable and cosmopolitan section of the same block.
There was once a King, when I was just thirteen years of age, a man of unusual stature and of extraordinary wealth.
You see, you and me, he said, we are both at once immortal.
In the early winter of the year 1859, at eight o'clock in the morning, an old man in a white frock coat and tie, with a shapeless nightshirt and a short-sleeved navy jacket over his shoulders, making his way along Ninth Street, the tall, slim, middle-aged gentleman, who had spent nearly four hundred dollars on rent and was past the end of his rope, approached the pale little domeless figure in the doorway of the old country home, which stood in the heart of the fashionable section of Ninth Street.
The first time I saw Celine drape the tray table of her crib across the kitchen window, it was bed-fellow Alex, looking through the window and murmuring, "Oh, there's a boy."
There was never a finer time to prove a point than out of our own reach.
He should have known it, for he was such a fool in the beginning.
In the late winter of the year 1859 the whole country was in a state of emergency, especially in the town of Mayfield, and the air was filled with the fearful impression of a coming war.
It was a cold and snowy morning in early November, which brought into the family a large group of guests.
"My dear old father, my dear old man, you've got to be crazy."
Is it any wonder that the minds of the earth have been so constantly turned to the future, that the present has been so much the subject of speculation?

Unicorn songs, as they exist in the land beyond the clouds, are long forgotten.
It seemed that the day was out of difficulties; it was the end of the world: the sun was about to go out and nobody could stop him.
When the pegasus gave the order for the destruction of the Jedi Temple, the whole world was watching; it was a great mistake.
Some time before the disaster that afflicted the city of Traver, under the watchful eye of the wizard of Galentine, a young maiden named Padma Praline of the house of Pommaries, stood before the Great CENTIME, and told the tale of a sick little princess named Noa, who had been sold into slavery by her generous master, and by her cruel mother, by the spirited chaperone of the wise and virtuous woman known as Lady Elizabeth, who, however, was never more than sixteen years old.
When the princess, Noa, who was then just sixteen years old, first met her cruel and unhappy fate she was as young as a pegasus; but, as she was then called, she was one of the bravest and most lovely princesses ever to sit upon the throne of Ages, and as brave and beautiful as a bull in a stallion.
She was called Astrid, and she was a little girl, and she had a stick and a torch, and she used to dream of a land where she might live happily ever after with her loving husband and beautiful little daughter and little son.
I am a horse-sized unicorn. I am a unicorn!
The image of the open sky above Paradis was not just any image, of course, but the image of a land.
The day a large party of Middle-earthers from a remote stage stage managed to make it onto the famous bridge across the sea between the two cities of Eregion and Nargothrond was not unusual.
I am a unicorn pony.
I am a human, really.
A sad looking human, wrapped up in a cloak of invisibility and security, lay upon the ground near the spot where the last of the rain had ceased to fall.
The sun shone brightly and the air in the narrow corridors of the Palace seemed to have never been so full of life.
The unicorn princess sat looking up from the book lying on her lap in the shade of a tree.
The shadow of a great castle halted before the door of the home on the first story of a house.
The sun glittered in the sky, setting the shadows and drawing the curtains of the house in the warm light of a large summer day.
The sun shone brightly, and the air in the room was warm and rich with autumnal aroma.
In every generation something is born, something new, something that is not quite like what people think it is.

"You're been with me from the beginning, Dash," said my sister, "and ever since you were little, you've had an unrequited crush on me."
Don't know why, but whenever I think of the family that my brother James and I were raised in, I think of my brother James and my sister Kathryn.
My father was a criminal, and the murder of his wife was no exception.
The rain began to fall hard as a door slammed.
The fire had not yet subsided from the ruins of the old slum when a sick, battered pony with a messy moustache and a burned wings folded over her head stood in the doorway of the house where I grew up.
A young, blue-eyed stallion rose from among the ruins of the great forest, and at first sight, he appeared to be nothing more than a helpless, ragged visitor.
I was born twice: once to a mother who didn't know what to do with me, and once to a mother who was desperate to get me out of there.
In the midst of the great maze of blind alleys and crumbling buildings of London, on a sunny summer day in the year 1665, the poet and philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson was able to enjoy the quiet hours of his childhood when he alighted on streets where he could chat with pedestrians and shopkeepers without arousing suspicion.
The clocks were striking nine at breakfast when I entered the office of my sister Elizabeth (Ellen) Alder, and I am sure that I have been guilty of a very foolish and a very dangerous mistake at first sight.
The alleys were quiet here in the West End of London when:
The street was empty.
The trees swayed in the breeze.
The fire burned.
The fire burned, and he was never seen alive again.
You know how often houses go up in smoke, or disappear altogether, or never set at all?
Outside of the Rydell ward of St. Albans there was an old woman living in a house that had once been a hospital.
The air was cool in the little garden, but it was so hot it was nearly burning the grass all over.
When the white-haired girl got home she found herself in a cold and dark house, where the light castle was all that there was, and the dog that ran in and out of the room was quite a bother.
It was a bright, gray October morning in the year 1675.
The infinitesimals thought the gas giant was the seventh great god of the universe, but it wasn't.
The seven worlds in the Solar System were united under a single celestial body, the sun-worlds called the Inner Tribunal.
John, the first president of the American Academy of Arts, Sciences, and the Fine Arts, of the City of New York, has written to me with great attention, and in the most confidential manner, expressing his wish to know whether there can be any doubt concerning the truth of what M. Poncelet, my friend, and myself, have distinctly stated in our History of the Chinese People, that the first laws of the Chinese Academy of Arts, and of the Chinese people, were established by the guidance of the spirit of the very most ancient and profound antiquity, and were made ready for the use of the few of the most ancient, and the most ancient, with the most careful and regular elaboration; and that these laws were not only laws for the good of mankind, but laws of the most holy, and of the most holy nations; and that these laws are the result of long and probable experience, and the industry of the most enlightened minds; and that, with all probability, they have been generally and perfectly observed and observed by mankind; and that, in reference to the limits of the Chinese Academy, we have been very deficient.
The sea was all calm.
The great forest, in which, as we have heard, the gods dwell, is on the western coast of Eurasia, and consists of evergreen trees and evergreen shrubs, or in other words, of evergreen woods; but in truth it is but a complicated knot of every kind of wood, and forms, as I have already related, a very large and important tract.

The stars were all golden and the heavens were as glittering as gold jewelry.
I don't know who the audience was expecting, but it sure as hell wasn't anypony else.
"You've got to be kidding me," Twilight said.
It was midnight and all the magic was still going on.
The words had never really entered her head again.
The Fall had been quiet since earlier that week.
People used to say that the Magic was dead, that it had disappeared forever, that it wasn't worth the effort, that it was nothing more than superstition.
The first light of the day was as white as a sheet of paper and as clear as glass.
The white cloud of clouds that stretched eastward across the water had been there for some days, carrying with it the cry of the restless sea.
A second position was gained, and a third, and then a hundred and fifty, and then a thousand and twenty nine.
It was an apartment in the town on the river, and until one morning when the landlord woke from a nightmare and rushed to the door, he had no idea what he had gotten himself into.
I went to school just like everypony else, to learn.
That's what Luna need'a been tellin'.

It was a long and arduous journey, and a long one indeed, that brought me to my final destination: the village of Angelport, on the bank of the river Trent, in the province of the Madrigals.
It had been a long time since the town was more populous than it was in the middle days of the last century.
It was a cold and stormy night, and if there had been any mist in the little village of Angelport the inhabitants might well have been at their thieving best.
On their return from hunting, the Pensive party found a large herd of wild oxen stretching for miles along the bank of the Trent.
There had been a ruckus of voices and whistles and the shouts of joy in the streets and even in the barn, when the men of the Pensive had reached the town of Angelport, which lay between the mountains of the West and the valleys of the East.
The village of Angelport lay on a little stream on the bank of the river Trent.
The Good Clothes came through the open door of the Townhouse on the Niagara, and when they had attracted attention they had set about, in a manner which was somewhat unusual, of arranging for the dress of the proprietors, although a prudent one, to suit the age of the town.
The sun was setting on the day that Ephron called him to understand that he had overshot his task.
By the time the twins had made their way out of the house at Northgate, they had all but forgotten the absolute horror which had befallen them.
The funeral of Mr. Clarke House, died always a stranger to his neighbours, or at any rate to his kinsman, had been celebrated with the usual cordiality.
The first time I saw the house, I was on my own in a small village, in the provincial town of Rinkhall, where I was not yet nineteen years old.
It was autumn and the woods were full of blackberries and hazelnuts, or rather their delicate oils.
I have always been very fond of the Congo, and I have travelled in many parts of it during my career, but I have never been able to come anywhere near one of the major towns of that country, where or who I should like to see, or where I should like to see anything.
There was once
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
"You think you can do this?"
"This is important."
The raptor bit down on the muzzle of his quills, but it was too keen a wound.
The spoilers lie on the horizon.
For a moment, the moon was a blue marble, its golden hue shifting in the light of the moonlit summer night.
I founded the Library of the Damned, the library of the dead, to learn as little as possible of the knowledge of the living.
"Enough," said the old man in the little London alley.
The great hall of the Queen-Groom's Court looked up from the floor of the church.
There was a man in the street, but he was no great man, and he had no money.
The trolls of the Southern kingdom of Minya had long since ceased to fear the day when the civilized races of that land would find greater strength than their friendly ignorance had permitted them to realize. 
My father threw me out of the womb, and before I knew it, I was sitting on the floor of the mud-puddle.
When Mr. Roger Blythe, of the Knapp Company, was old enough to buy a horse and carriage, and had the least money in the world, he had the honor of buying one of what was then called the 'Baron's Money-House' in the street of St. Mary's, where he now lives in a flat and furnished house, with a garden and a verandah, but in which there are scarcely twenty-five persons in the whole of it; and he has lived, as he told it in the story, for ever and ever, without having any friends or any personal possessions of any sort; not even the slightest money, and when he speaks of his possessions it is in the sense of plenty of things; but he has never been in want of anything, or of anything of any importance, in the whole world, or in his whole lifetime; and he certainly never has been in any very ill-fortune; and yet he has been in many indeed fortunate and fortunate circumstances and has been in many fortunes of all kinds and all kinds; and though he has never been in any financial difficulty, and if he had any doubt of that, he would have no doubt of it now, he has never been in a position of great or great inconvenience or difficulty; and yet there have been times when he thought it all over, and when he found that he was so poor and so wretched that he could not possibly have amassed so much wealth in his lifetime; and he had thought that he was much richer than he really was; but there has never been any way of testing this, nor any way of having any thing like determination in the matter, which, if it had been possible, he would not have known how to work out for himself; and although he himself had long been in disuse, he had never had any taste for anything beyond the ordinary necessities of life; and though, for long years he had been content as regards material things, the happy result had been, no doubt, that he had been at no loss for a career lasting an indefinite number of years, during which he had not failed in obtaining a livelihood whose success he had long known, or rather had been absolutely certain of, and had ever been fully conscious of; and though for many years after he had ceased to be in want of any sort of material comforts, and even for a livelihood of a very temporal character, or of material comfort, within the smaller limits of the earth; and though perhaps there had been times when he had been in some circumstances in which he had been doing better than he truly was; at any rate, he had been in every respect in which he might have been expected to perform, in all probability at most one thousandth part of what he had performed, and he had been as perfectly consistent and as industrious as any other person in the world; not merely in his own mind, but also in the whole body of his society; and this proved that he had never been in any sort of distress.
"What a waste of good money!" said the old man in the little London alley.
A hare has its particular place.
There was a girl, born in Ulthofes, and who had loved her mother, and yet had still loved herself.
The old man stood there, staring, and Mr. Roger Blythe entered, and began to say that these are the papers of the old man, and also that he had brought them from the old man himself, and that he had given them to the new man, and that he knew that the old man was dead, when the new man had the good luck to discover his father's body, and when the old man had died himself; but that he knew nothing of death, and of death, and of the transition.
"Who's there?"
"There
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
I caught the flood of pearly light coming from the far horizon. I turned to look, but it was too late.
"Tell me more about the great Dark Lord," said the voice that was always the same but was completely different every time. 
I stood on top of a hill, overlooking the marshland beyond the trees.
I have stumbled upon a treasure. 
This is a story of the great dangers of the time; of the scurrying, the deceitful, the game-change, and the unmerciful.
The little restaurant was packed. 
The most beautiful voice I've ever heard died after a single question.
A pale, ugly little pony sat down on a dump of earth and watched as a great colossus rose from the depths of the earth.
Amber, a little more than a year old, sat at her mother's desk, her hooves resting on the very smooth surface of the paper.
Carol and her friend were standing on the edge of a stream.
I haven't heard of an Equestrian's sweetheart until she's gone, but that's exactly what I am.
The ground was covered in a thick layer of dust and mud, a layer that spread across the landscape like a blanket.
The girl was wearing a torn dress and a pair of tiny, fussy heels.
She was sitting on the couch in the living room of a house in the middle of nowhere, drinking a glass of water which she hoped would last through the night.
The moon rose and rose, as all the wise men in the land did.
The unicorn fire starter was on its last two weeks of life, but on a good day the fire didn't need the air so much as it needed the rain and the moaning.
The child stood on the edge of a cliff, looking back at the water below and the blue sky above.
The moon had just set and the children were sitting on the lawns, waiting for the cartoons to end.
There was once a man and a woman, the man called John and the woman called Elizabeth.
I remember the day I heard my mother say, 'Get up, my baby.'
Dear Polistinale, I don't know how to begin this letter.
You're probably wondering why I'm writing to you right now.
Did you know that the maximum weight for a single, gone. begun to exist is three pounds?
My bad, I just wrote you a letter.
I am a tramp who lives in a cave.
Lea standing on the edge of the water, watching the trees in the distance shake and bend.
Nicole burst through the door to her brother Andrus's room, screaming, "What's happened?"
I had planned to write a message to the past, but now that I am no longer alive, that message is now meaningless to me.
The moon glistened in the light of the sun, like the rest of the moon.
This is a story of the terrible events that were to follow when the world of Mystra was brought to a halt.
Another most beautiful of the Princesses was born, this time a girl, named Victoria.
My mother gave me the gift that I now know only as the wand of madness.
The universe is a place of infinite possibilities.
Fifty-four years ago today, a tiny space craft called the Phaethon was launched into orbit around the sun, the very center of the universe.
She'd always had nightmares.
Two weeks ago, I was playing with my niece and nephew, Tom and Lottie, on the beach of their home on the eastern shore of the Isle of Wight.
The city of New Orleans is the perfect size for a big lake, and is indeed a great lake, with a remarkably deep and wide body of water.
I know that it isn't always easy to get your life in order.
One evening, when the sky was still a sheet of digital blue, the moon was just beginning its slow rise to the horizon, the stars huge and faint, the sea beautiful, and the clouds of gold and silver blowing about as under a gentle breeze.
The old man was a little older than I am, and more than a little older, for I was only twelve years old when my father died.
It has happened in my life that I have found what I believe to be the explanation for all the mysteries of the universe, and that is the only explanation that I can think of.
The TARDIS lay motionless in the earth beneath the water's surface for an hour or so, and then it began to move again.
My father died.
When I was thirteen years old, my father sent me out to sea.
There are only two kinds of people in the world.
There was once a little girl whose name was Abig
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
Rainbow Dash had always wanted a real dragon, something more majestic, more terrifying.
Sugar: I'm going to tell you something shocking, and I know you won't like it, but no- I do not, and will never, ever, ever, ever say anything or do anything to the contrary, and I'm not going to let you down, Ariel.
Ponies were usually thought of as all-mighty and 'good' and 'powerful', or at best, noble and benevolent.
At the bottom of the sea, a tiny floating island, there lived a kindly old woman, the Princess.
"With my eye," said the voice of the voice-imp, "with my eye!"
Deep within a blue-green void, a very tall, very fair-looking man, and this he was very much proud of himself, like a proud and very happy man, very much pleased with himself, in the same way as a proud and very happy man is very happy with himself.
"It's not my fault," said the voice-imp to Ponyville once more.
Rainbow Dash smiled.
The chief engineer of the buffalo-leather empire of the Dust Province of the united Republic of the North, in the year of our Lord, and of the first summer, that is, going back to the year of our Lord 1,000 years ago, when the buffalo-leathers were first brought into use by the herders, and when the chief magistrate of the buffalo-leather country was Dinah the Crooner, 1,000 years ago, and the first king of the Dust Province of the united Republic of the North, was Dr. Looney Tunes, the most famous and influential inventor of all time, and of all time, and a very famous man, and indeed not only an eminent man, but a very famous man. He was one of the most famous and powerful men of his day; and yet, biographers say, he was not exactly the most famous of men, although, indeed, for a number of reasons, no individual of his century is truly known to all except his immediate family and close friends. This has led to the remark that, in the eyes of the public, the most famous and powerful man of the century was not, to put it quite mildly, not very famous. But the fact remains that, on the eve of the decisive battle of Waterloo, the frontiers of the United States were divided on a great scale, in an event which will be called the Waterloo of the World, because, in consequence of the battle of Waterloo, the fundamental rights of the United States had been altered in the United States; and by the state of America at the time of the battle of Waterloo, the rights of the citizens of the United States had been altered and the powers of government had been destroyed and the American government was no more, but the United States itself was a vast republic made up of countless individuals and colonies, of which the former had been Americans, and the latter had been non-Americans. This general view seems to be correct, however, if we suppose, as historians have done, that there existed in the United States two separate sovereign powers, one representing the states and the other the people; or if we suppose that the United States were divided into several parts, and that each of these parts, or parts, was a sovereign state, depending for its existence upon the consent of the other parts; or if we suppose that the United States were divided into two great civil powers, one of which, though not the wealthiest, exercised the greatest influence and was the most powerful, and that the second, after its (the United States') death, was entirely dependent for its existence upon the consent of the first; or if we must conclude from these considerations that we have, even in our present state, become one people, and that it is the wish of the American people, that they should be united into one country, and that the United States should then be a distinct and independent nation; or, more precisely, that there should exist two independent nations, one, and the other, though not of equal power and importance; the former of which was the greater, and the latter the lesser part of the former, or which was superior to the latter; or, more precisely, that the United States were divided into two different nations, one, and the other, but not equally powerful or inferior, or, in short, that there existed a force, which by the terms of the Constitution was, and is, and ever shall be, and always shall be, an independent nation, dependent on the consent of the other three, or at least, a federal government; and that the powers and prerogatives of government were then in the hands of a federal government, which, though a very important one, was not so important or powerful as, or in any way inferior to, that of which it claimed to
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
Every day, my mother would begin the day by telling me to get up.I would have my fill of that bitch but I was a sieve, and I only ever made one mistake.
Wow, my penis is long, and it feels better in my pants than it would be otherwise.
Pinkie Pie was a hopeless prize.
It was in that same house that the stars danced and the moon, sweet and beautiful, soared through the clouds.
The moon was shining brightly, beyond the horizon in the morning light, like a diamond in the dark.
I had always believed that the world was flat, but actually it was round.
"Ponies go..." said Twilight, "Hey, could you whip these on for a couple of secs before you start?"
Rainbow Dash had taken to riding into her house on her pink saddle hoof, noting the rows of fifth-story windows that led from her backyard down into the city.
Somepony lives to be a thousand years old.
Rainbow Dash had always wanted to be a princess.
Twilight touched her forehead and sighed.
There was a story in the forest that told of a young princess named Agnes.
"Splenso, don't you come outside, come on, we don't want to hurt you," Crystal said.
"A Swan take a back way and a flight of stairs, down the bank of a stream, across an overgrown field, and up a winding bank of a great lake, and up the bank of a great river, and down again, into the plain of a village."
Rainbow Dash was standing on the bank of the Manticore River, watching the morning moon.
This is how it begins, with the worst kind of tail, a drag that shakes the hooves and shakes the backbone, that runs parallel to the ground and has little effect on movement of the body.
She stood in the doorway of the bank, and the crystal ball was spinning in her fingers.
"Mister Bitter, have you ever seen a dragon?"
Rainbow Dash had always liked dragons.
I remember he had a pet mountain lion named Yondu.
Rainbow Dash had always had a crush on Rainbow Dash and was so happy when her opinion of him changed.
Rainbow Dash blinked at the moon and saw the glitter of the friends' tears around her.
Twilight had twisted a few pages of a book and was now reading the words, watching them float past her head like wet dreams.
Rainbow Dash turned at the last minute to see her friend sitting on the bank watching her.
Almost instantly Rainbow Dash noticed the moon glittered behind her, like a crystal ball of light.
She was having a bad day.
Rainbow Dash stood up and trotted through the gardens, running up the side of a hill and across the grass, until she reached the top of a bluff above the water's surface.
The sky was half-circled by stars, and the clouds seemed to have no idea where they were or what direction they were blowing.
Hidden in plain sight, just across the water's edge from where the water ran through the woods, an old dresser stood, a dock in the corner, a door to the sea beyond the water's edge, and an old school for ponies to learn in.
I have seen many adventures.
The gap between worlds is so vast, so vast that it is impossible to tell where it ends and begins.
Rainbow's imagination was an echo of her senses and a recording of her thoughts.
The ship was not responding.
The sun had long since died out of view; the sea lay long and dark, shrouded in mist and gray-green foamy foam.
There was once a princess, more beautiful in every way than her title would indicate.
I threw away my sword and fled, with only a few other ponies.
My name is James Kalashnik.
Ponies of Equestria, relax, because this is going to get complicated. 
I am writing this down for the first time in my life. 
I stood there on my rooftop, reading a book, thinking about Equestria, but also wondering what my life would be like if I hadn't been trapped in the sky.
"Oh, c'mon," said Fluttershy. "I think we should get moving."
"Did you hear him?" said Rarity, looming over the hedge.
These are the stories of my life.
Moonlight wings spread in a spring breeze, danced above a valley, and amid the trees and the wildflowers of Equestria, a hunter, after a long hunt, found the body of a strange little pony who had been snatched from him by a couple of rude villagers.
No matter how hard it started, it wasn't over.
Through the lower levels of the Forbidden
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
The fire began to burn down the steps leading into the parking lot of the Rarity estate in Equestria.
"That recipe's on me," said the woman to her lawyer, sitting down in a seat at the end of the court.
This past week, as we started to pick up the pieces of what will probably be a very long and very busy legal battle of mine, I had a chance to chat with a friend of mine in the court, an authority witness who I hoped would have some useful insight into the case.
Last night I was out with my relatives; however, I do not believe that the weather was unusually hot or cold for that year.
The sun rose out of the dark blue sky, like it had never seen a blue sky before.
A tall, slender, and slender-built man, with dark hair and a reddish of face, sat in the cockpit of an airship.
A small, yellow-eyed girl with black hair and a silver-gray face sat on the opposite side of a white-striped cardboard train seat.
I was born in the first world, in the middle of the seventeenth century.
In the early years of the last century, there was much talk of the great plague of the sixteenth century.
The morning light shimmered in a windowless room at the end of the brightly lit garage where it had been stored for a very long time.
Maud Turf was one of the owners of the Haymarket.
The light was beating down hard on the driveway, its sound a piercing and piercing cry.
The world may not have begun with a beginning, but it certainly began with a beginning.
When it gets to be nine on a Saturday, you're all done.
I am the One, the First, the Last and the last.
It was the sixties, and maybe it's only a decade, but the notion of density as a measure of measure of power doesn't have any obvious analogue.
It was a dark, stormy winter day in April, that the weatherman saw the first of the great condensation showers.
When he was seven, my oldest brother, Paul, ran away from home.
Somewhere in the far reaches of space, in a crystal-blue cell the size of a small world, there lived an immortal, immortal being who was too immortal to die.
There was a time when the world was a place where every more beautiful thing was possible.
The world of Equestria had always been quiet.
At the age of twelve, just after his parents were married, my teacher, the brave and reliable Equestrian Royal Mage, brought me into his School, and made me a seat on the First Council of the Order.
The spell for transforming into a Pegasus was fairly simple; it involved taking off one's outer clothes to reveal the inner body of the Pegasus.
Ael and Eura were twins, but they were not very good friends.
The apartment was a small one, half an acre, and at the center of it, a plain old old two-room apartment with a little even-sized parlor and a small front porch. 
It is a moonless night, but it is still oily and warm, as though the waters of the sea had been covered and all the heat of the sun had been drained out of the earth.
At the end of the day, when you are ready to begin, you may as well have had your fill of the world.
The sun was setting on the face of the earth when the ship in which I was then operating arrived in the seas near the city in which I now live.
The last time I knew my father, he was dead.
The sun was setting on the earth when the good and poor deep down in the earth went about their business, as it were in a circle; but even in their midst the traces of civilization still stir; and when absolute darkness fell over the southern half of the earth, few of the inhabitants of that half-submerged continent, not even those who called themselves the inhabitants of the middle hemisphere, or even of that inter-mixed continent lying between these two poles, could have known that their whole past was passing away before their eyes.
The stormy seas of the Southern Ocean were teeming with the beautiful and miraculous.
Coming from the north, the stray collard wildflowers of the Jove-kiney trees bore witness to the strong auroral display.
The formless shapes of the islands lie obscured in their midst by the silent, eternally moving waters of the sea, so that even now, through what is called the pre-eminent age of sea-consecration, it is impossible for the wise and trustworthy to distinguish between the plain, watery, and still-mantley of the Shield Islands, and the seas of the Parth
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
"At least I'm not going to eat them," said the silky-voiced pony—fully aware that the pink pegasus was packing a bag full of the pastries in case he ran into an unusual custom in the future, and in anticipation of Croaking to find a new friend to eat with.
Rainbow Dash thundered down the hall of the Palace, her hooves pounding against the stone walls.
Longtime readers know that the eponymous character in My First Adventure is the daughter of a famous explorer and politician, but I want to throw the spotlight on another member of the Princess Celestia family.
The sun held out a little above the horizon.
The grass sloped from a meandering mass of a green, into a plain, the size of a city.
The darkness began to cool.
The first sun of the spring that year was shining brightly in the west, casting a long silver glow over the Rocky Mountains.
The rafters of the palace jutted into the night, the stars fluttering across the blue sky.
The night was bright even before the first light of dawn.
"I think that's it, then, my dear friend," said Prince Zoragon as he turned his back on the landscape, "and all will be well. I am free, though I doubt it. Even an assassination attempt in the capital would be unlikely. Oh, I know it's a bad idea. I was at a party once."
Does anyone know where Oar, the king of the sea, is?
The world is a magical place, but the things it can do are mostly unintelligible to us, and yet they are so very powerful.
"What are you thinking of?"
It was a dark, stormy night, when the ship's captain, Captain Sparsheim, had the sudden idea of inviting a female artist, Mrs. Charles Bishop, into his cabin.
The volume of the sun was dropping rapidly.
"There's a soul here, in all of you!"
It was a glorious time of the great Golden Age.
Death was neither here nor there.
It was something of a revelation to me just how much my imagination stretched.
The moon sank low in the sky, like the moon itself.
A blue flashing light rose above the sky, and then the light fell apart.
This is the story of the Blackverse, which I shall call after my dear friend Loki the Good.
When I was little and in love with my brother, I had a pegasus friend.
The sun shone like a furnace, burning every living thing in the sky.
"DUDE," Majesty said, "you're going to murder my sister."
Bastien tried to scruple to hide his excitement.
I have heard it said that every fantasy begins with a man and a horse, an island in the middle of a sea, and that this is a story of the easy assimilation of a long-suffering young man into an ocean of what is called California, although in reality it is in fact only a series of interrelated stories all told by a younger and less experienced right hand.
I believed in the sun.
The Dark Times of my life were unendurable.
The leather bedding lay on the cold floor of the guest bedroom, across from the fire.
"Mister, I think I have a terrible case of the thirty-second degree heat eye."
The night the colts began to leave the barn and into the dark, silent streets of Winnebago County, they left the old-fashioned small-fashioned back yard that had been their winter home.
Standing on the silvered, red-tiled roof of the farmhouse stood water and a lone pine.
The wind howls and howls on; there's no life here in the swamps of Weymouth.
The road to the lake was sharp and rough.
Good morning, my dear.
The day's going well, and I am very tired of sitting still all day, and all after dark, and all the rest of it; but I am going to lie down. 
The doorstep was the worst part of the whole thing. 
The great Eagle of the West brought all the world to the brink of creation.
The old man sat on a stool in a corner of a house, watching the city of Isandl.
In a huge, winding, maze-like corridor, on the second floor of a building called a 'chapel', beneath a street of ornately carved stone, there sat a man.
Quickly, without looking at anything, I bounded across the floor to a window in the second story.
I needn't have told you that I have a dream.
Somewhere in the vastness of space, there lived a man with red hair and
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
- Metal crown on head- 3 -
The end of the magic school semester was approaching and the students were heading over to their classes.
- There you are. - Shining a worried glance over the archway just in front of the door, Twilight sighed.
Twilight left her room and stepped out into the living room of her hooves.
A violet cloud shimmered above her head, floating towards the stars.
You know, Twilight, I don't think I always knew you.
Twilight's girlfriends often talked about the weather.
The factory was humming along in the evening and the day was going well.
Saddle up, smoke-horn in her hooves, and buckle up, because the ride on the ground is going to be interesting.
Cannonball Oobleck is one of the crowded, jaunty underlings who flit into the forest to party accidentally.
Serenity cast the last of her net on the Queen's second moon, soaring high above the likeness of an alder-maiden in the deep, silent night.
Until the diamond cut off her hair, Mare was as white as a sheet of white paper.
The distant moon was shining brightly in the soft light of the eastern sky.
The Spring Equinox is a nationwide holiday celebrated by the general populace as the day when all life was blessed with freedom of thought and expression.
Even at thirteen years of age, Twilight Sparkle knew she was destined to one day become the dominant personality in her line of work.
I thought you wanted to see my job, then.
I must have been eleven when I saw you standing there in my school hallway with my notebook in your hooves.
Twilight had always loved math.
------------------
A green hoof bounced gently in the small of Twilight's back, the soft, wispy sort that colorless teal hooves are particularly good at bouncing.
The giant pachyderm with horns the size of a home was about to make his first-ever foray into the desert when the buzz came over the radio.
Her eyes traveled up the empty, silent hall of the Hall of Dragons, the fifth floor, where the three architects of the city waited.
"This is it, really, Twilight."
Boot…
"All right."
The sun rose in the morning, and I was already an hour and a half into the morning run.
"Don't have to worry about me, Twilight. I've been thinking about you all morning."
These are the stories of life and times you've been living through.
At first it was all about the rain.
On a cold day in May, fifteen years ago, I had the dream I had been dying to see for some time: a small, orange-colored world, smooth and flat, with a clear blue sky and a clear blue lake, just beyond the reach of stars and planets.
The sun rose in the southeast and stayed up for four days.
When the sun rose the smallest of the day stars in the eastern sky were just visible, but the sun had already set and the darkness was deep and the stars shone faintly.
The moon was in the sky and looked like a jewel when she rose, but I never did see it bigger than a ball, and it wasn't until I was seventeen that I realized I was bigger than the moon.
Her name was Elice and forever after, even now when I regret not having the courage to ask her name, I will not forget her dark face when she looked up at me with such wonder and such complete and utter confusion and such a strange and almost sadistic delight in the face of such great disappointment and such a strange and almost sadistic delight in the face of such great fear and such deep and profound fear.
Twilight's mother had been trying to talk her into taking a trip to Ponyville.
In the middle of the night I was lying on the floor of my hooves, staring up into the brilliant blue sky.
The sun was shining.
On the morning of the day the moon rose, the dragon Cheerios burst through the door and began the long, short and bitter journey to become a dragon.
"It's morning now," Kalak said, "and the sun is shining, and the grass is growing tall and bright and fragrant, and nobody is noticing me, so to speak. I make no real effort to be noticed, except the one time I streak across the grass and up a tree and take a swing at those who are looking."
Rainbow Dash felt so tired she couldn't even tell the day.
Death, it was said, was something you could not live without.
Rainbow Dash had been going through a bad patch of writing for a few weeks now, but if the last few months had gone by she had not long since come to the realisation that the final word
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.


I have had the patience of a thousand years, and I have been well pleased.
The starlit sky of the big city glowed with the soft light of frost, and the moon shone bright and clear over the city.
So that's what you're saying, Rainbow?
TW and back up.


Applejack and Pinkie Pie, her mother and sister, all on one hoof in space, watching on with wonderment.


Rainbow Dash hit the ground hard and rolled backwards.


"...That's a really big kissie, like..."


Rainbow Dash stared up at the ceiling with a broad grin.


Rainbow Dash sat on her haunches and looked down at a firm blank horizon.


"That's a really big kissie, like a princess, or a princess horse."


Rainbow Dash sat on her haunches and looked at a blank horizon.


The sun lingered above the green and the blue sky like a dying star, just rising the same way every morning.


There was a quiet, slow, gentle breeze blowing over the land from Tenderloin to the EB Street Bridge.


There was a quiet, quiet, gentle breeze blowing over the tren earlier that day but the wind was too heavy and too slow to keep up with its flow.


The master troll lay on the ground, his legs crossed.


Rainbow Dash sat on her haunches and looked at a blank horizon.


Rainbow Dash watched as the grand finale was played out on stage and then on TV.


Leaf held her hoof flat against the back of the head, and the rest of her body relaxed into the hovering motion of the completed form.


The sun rose high in the sky over Manehattan.


Rainbow Dash sat on her haunches and watched as the grand finale was played out on stage and then on TV.


"Rainbow!"


Rainbow Dash lay down on the grass and glanced up at the sky.


Light and shadow.


Rainbow Dash lay still and watched the still.


Rainbow Dash sat still and looked down at the ground.


Rainbow Dash lay still and stared up at the sky.


Rainbow Dash lay down on the grass.


Rainbow Dash looked up at the foot of Celestia.


Rainbow Dash stood facing the sky and said, "Okay, that's enough of this," and she should have known better than to ask for a better answer.


Rainbow Dash sat still and watched the still.


Rainbow rode into the door of the guild hall and pulled her whip out of her saddlebag.


Rainbow Dash sat down on the grass and peered up at the sky.


The sun rose high in the sky over Manehattan.


Rainbow Dash stepped out of the shade of a tall, thin, elfin pony with a thick, curly tail.


Rainbow Dash held the whip out to the sky.
…and back up.


Rainbow Dash had been expecting the best.


Rainbow Dash pulled her head from the ground and looked skyward, feeling the warmth of the sun on her forehead.


It was a good day for growing trees.


Rainbow rushed through the gate and saw a tiny world of pink and green peering up into the clear blue sky.


…and back up.


Rainbow waited.


Rainbow Dash fell from the hollow hill into the swamp of the bemusement of her fellow ponies.


The sun rose high in the sky over Manehattan.


Rainbow trotted through the porch.


Rainbow Dash was a hasty and groping traveller, always carrying some form of burdens on her back, but the Seven Seas of Latron on the banks of the river had always been a friendlier place.


Rainbow Dash sat down on the grass and stared out at the blue sky.


Rainbow Spitfire was born in the year of the realisation of the poet, that is, in the year 1855.


The sun rose high in the sky over Manehattan.


The sun peered over the dusty plains of the Tanglewood and its huge hairy old crag, twisting and turning.


It was a busy afternoon, and Queen Chrysalis was busy with some matters of state.


It was a warm winter's night and the great city of Manehattan was lit up with the fragrance of the flax and the honeycomb.


Rainbow Dash sat down on her haunches and looked down at the blank gray blue horizon.


Rainbow Dash stood up and trotted across the grass, trotted down a short flight of steps and to the door of the cottage she had recently moved into.


Rainbow
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
The moon shone out bright red in the night wind against the ferns, and the quiet water inside the broken vessel was already beginning to thicken.
Rain spots the moon with fingertips.
The yellowing black sky stretched across the horizon like a sort of shroud, its crests brighter than a mirror.
Twilight's fingertips felt for the beast, but she'd never seen it touch a living thing before.
The moon shone between the trees, though her eyes told her otherwise.
The moon shone out orange-red, like a sunset.
The wind howled in the distance, and the stars danced in the sky like dancing blades of grass.
"I hope we'll be okay... at least." said Pinkie, resting her hoof on the end of Twilight's hoof.
"Stormy dinner," mused the dragon.
No one had ever told me that the sky was the limit of reality.
The night air was thick with magic, but what magic was there, if anything, was to be found in the bedrock of Equestria.
Rainbows began to fall, crops began to turn brown, ponies began to grow hooves and hooves and hooves and hooves of grass, and all the heat blown in by the magic of the sun, all the wind that blew in by the magic of the air, all the magic of what looked like three tons of lead, all the magic that came from the air itself—all the magic that was in the air, and out of the air, and hidden in the ground and the sky and whatever else the magic of the air and air and the magic of water and whatever else the magic of the water came from, and out of the water, and out of water and out of water and into dust.
One carriage titanic, the others tiny, the last two taken up in a fixed body, as though all those tiny creatures had been transferred into one big, angry, destructive thing.
Rainbow was standing on the edge of a large solid platform, which looked down on an empty and craggy plain.
The water was cold and muddy and green.
The sun was low over the horizon, shining as though it wished to drown or burn or otherwise destroy all else.
Rainbow was standing on the edge of a large solid platform, which looked down upon an empty and craggy plain.
It was near-fall after a rough summer, when the wind of life suddenly shifted in which direction it might, and those living who had any hope of ever living at all were thrown back into the dark and fearful depths of despair.
"Ah, the first time you heard the voice of the Unicorn, the voice of the Twilight that weeps so sweetly for no other reason than to console you."
The ponies had made it to the streets of Ponyville before the hooves of the tiny ponies began to tremble.
There is only one thing that can make up for all three hundred years, and it is this: the greatest of all fairytales.
You've had it, Mr. and Mrs. Equestria.<|endoftext|>The day you die, the day you're gone, the few words that you need to know before you die are as follows:
"Blind all night, by the lake of the Nyarlathotep."
"I am a visitor from another town."
The courtyard was deep, dark and cold, and there had been voices and whatnot from long before.
"I am your mother, Sammy. I love you."
It was a cold, rainy, windless night in mid-September that put the Doctor Simon Halliday for a man.
"It's not a poke, it isn't a kiss."
And so here it is!
"I've been getting glimpses of the sky lately, when the birds stop singing and the rains suddenly stop."
The stars in the night sky used to be bright and clear, and the stars in the sky used to be big and bright and colourful.
It was a cold, rainy, windless night in mid-September that put the Doctor Simon Halliday for a man.
The ceremony was at Midnight.
"You should be alive, Lord."
The soft sound of the glass breaking makes the room shake.
"Yes, I know who did it, Doctor."
"I'm going to slip the deprogrammer a drug," said the Doctor.
The cellophane-wrapped top of the bus was all that separated the car park from the rest of the busy city, and the shade of the trees that sprang up all around it from the deep blue and dark brown of the surrounding urban scrub.
It was a cold, rainy, windy night that burned the grass beneath the wheels of the Edgewood Shops in London, and the trees that made their homes in the thin, broad street that ran
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
The nine brave stallions of the unicorn army marched through the deep snow toward the city.
Spice Stare was once a pretty green little town on the eastern coast of North America.
The Clinging Mountains are vast and winding, nearly as long as their waters.
In the open, on a clear spring day, three little, pink-furred dolls lay on their sheboards, listening to the beating of a rooster.
The sun rose smoothly, like silk, over the empty mountains.
Glass Doorway was a dark, dangerous place, an ungovernable place, where the wicked and the foolish ruled together.
The first thing Professor Sprout had to do was find a way to get her notebook out of the trunk behind the desk.
Snow drizzled on the salty, pocked roof.
Hairy, brown-headed, horn-rimmed owls squawk like mad at the slightest breeze, or if the frost thawed the wind behind the trees too eagerly.
On the day of the trial, the sun rose on a day of mild winter.
The tower was one of the most ancient structures of the Eastern Seaport, and in its hands the imperial court of the Mab, or Merchant Quarter, stood.
The blue sky was casting a soft, summer glow across the wide expanse of the Blue Pacific.
I was born in the year 1727.
One day my father came home from the hospital with a strange and troubling thought in his mind.
The Time Traveller was on his way and squashed up a fistful of tiny orange flowers and planted a small blue umbrella on the top of the garden.
My father said he was afraid of ghosts.
The ship went out of gas.
Near the intersection of the banks of the Thames and the river, one sees a wooden house with a touch of palace at the entrance.
The wind was blowing away from the north, the sea of sky fading and the stars shining brighter in the clear blue light of the morning.
The evening air is crisp, summer air with the occasional hint of frost.
The story is told not for the sake of story but to tell as it is: that there was a boy named Thalams to whom the Prince of the Realm had given a wish.
I did not realize that I was so old when I ascended into that vault of legend where all things were numbered, or that it would take me so long to reach that very place.
Who is silent, as if he were dreaming?
Three weeks ago I was driving home from a trip to the movies.
My mind is still a storm of excitement.
I have been in love with my brother long enough to remember when he used to come home to death-cassis.
In the dark hall of the palace, in the stable where he was kept, an old woman sat talking about something she had done.
My name is Lilith.
There are four seasons of the moon.
The moon shone in the streetlights on New Year's Eve, like it was the most beautiful thing ever seen.
This is the story of a man and his unfortunate bird.
I first met Silas Lovelace when he was nineteen years old and he was working as a dressmaker in the East End of London.
On a sultry February morning, in the west of England, a young man named Irens Leigh was playing chess on his own in the small garden of a house on Eusebeth's road.
The sun was setting, and the moon had already turned the blue, when a young man appeared, wearing a black silk evening dress, and holding a book in one hand and a dagger in the other, and standing in the doorway with the book in his lap, looking around the house, which was all of a sudden lit up with a faint gleam of light.
I have been writing an entry for many years now, and it has always been my conviction that there are many things that stand out to be noticed only in the past.
There was once such a person as Irensmith MacGregor Robinson, a man of sound mind and high ambitions.
It was a cold, grey, grey day near the end of September, and the ash from the great fire of Aldeburm had melted away in front of the shrine of the old man of Ashmole, and the friars of that house still prayed to the old man of the aorist.
One sunny, clear Saturday morning, when the flowers of the first autumn were in full bloom, a young woman was walking along the bus-stop in the Knightsbridge district.
The boy is a ghost.
As usual, the dusk wind was blowing fiercely from the north, and the snow-white water of the Great Lake was blowing white-rimmed and rainy.
The town of Rekisheim, which lies in

Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
"Nate?"
Having been conceived in the winter of my year, seventeen months after she was twenty-four years old, Bree executive of the Hearth, Earth and Water Gardens, Skylark of the Magic Gardens, and Malachite of the Crystal Metals, the first stage of her life saw her rise in the great Kingdom of Equestria from its tier-one position, into a far more stable, if very large, position.
Six months after she was born, Princess Cadence Shining Armor was sitting on a train headed for the Smithers, where she expected to find an elderly, dainty man sitting beside her.
A little over a year ago, the Princess of Corona made the decision to go back to her kingdom.
Twilight was sitting on the edge of the grass, watching the star make its entrance into the darkening sky.
"Twilight!"
One sunny Sunday afternoon, at the end of the summer when the sun shone brightest, the sun rose over the bosom of Equestria.
The fairy was lying in the summer pasture, watching the sun creep up the sky.
On an empty evening in the summer of that year, in the shadow of a broken highway overgrown with swamps of scrub, the magical lamp began to go out.
On a recent morning, after a few embarrassments, I got to the store.
"Oooohhh!" the bemused eyes of Rarity stared up at the ceiling.
Rain came down in sheets and gray, thick lines that washed over everything.
Somewhere in the depths of the blackness of space there stood a woman.
"Ahhh! The wind here does not like me!"
I am the greatest princess in the land of Equestria, but one of the most awful, impossible, and occasionally impossible princesses in all the land.
Friends: there were many!
In the time of the Great King, who lived about the year 31, there lived an age when the land was a kingdom, and the people that lived there were called Highlanders.
In confusion and terror, the Maya had come so far.
O eneendary dame, I have come to investigate a matter which may concern your mind.
The wedding party was being prepared for the wedding of the friend they called "Patty" the cherub.
A large, black, flying saucer loomed above the desert.
The entire town of Ti was in a deep slum and she thought the war was over.
At the time of the Great War, when the world was only six hundred and fifty-four thousand years old, the human race was not yet as advanced as it is now.
All of the real world, from the smallest village to the largest city, lies below the earth, at the level of the heavens.
One day, when it was too late, the sun was getting hot, but the air was clear and the sun shone down clear and there was no wind and there was no rain, the heavens parted and, even as now, a starless sky stretched out ahead of the earth and out of its reach.
There is but one prison, and that is the prison of ideas.
I was born in an age of great revolution.
This is a story about light.
The sixth day of the month of the month of Mars, lay the day when the sun moved into the night.
Twelve days were only sufficient to give the poor soul a measure of rest, and for three days they warmed him in the cold, but on the third day the heat of the weather came upon him again, and on the sixth day a sense of despair came over him; but on the ninth day, when his fever was beginning to subside, the fever of peace was beginning to subside.
The last full moon of the sultry afternoons of January and February, when the corn, or seed from a heavy crop, was being sown in the summer heat, was the last time that the air was clear and the moon shone pale and clear across the land; it is a mystery to many who understand the nature of things, that the moon shines so pale in summer, and so bright in winter, and so clear in the summer, that it sometimes appears to be cradling a corn-field in her arms.
Sometime in the spring of the year 3110, at the end of the last year of the reign of King Æthelred of Gethwin, the great catastrophe which had taken place in the year that is written still fathoms below, was confirmed.
During the year that is written on the left hand of the year 31, at the end of the year the name of King Æthelred of Gethwin, of the Second Dynasty, died.
The wind is coming.
The honeymoon of his eighteenth year, when he

I am a Stormbringer.
I am a thief in salamy, or perhaps a smuggler, for all I know voyages and dances and fish runs.
And it was one of the most lovely days of my life.
The three of us stood in the hall of the palace hall.
The guards stood there, watching, waiting, tucking their hats in their laps, but they were all more than enough.
He was locked up, and he was not a very good man, but he was not stupid either.
"My lord," said the gardener.
"I have been the victim of an unprovoked assassination," said the king.
The snow-white clouds parted, revealing a city of gleaming white sandstone towers, and the holy city of prels into the distance, and the towering black walls of the citadel in the distance, and the roaring crescent of the al-Mazheen to the north, and north and south, and the sky in the middle, and all the ways of the land.
The moon shone blue as silvery gold, and the moon-beams danced in the clear blue light of dawn.
I am a zealous and loyal student of the Canon, and I have ever been such, though I understand nothing of the Canon.
My name is Robert the roaster, and I am the father of four beautiful girls.
My mother told me once that the first person to reach the moon was a yorker, and that the first person to reach the sun was a roaster.
I am about to publish a poem I wrote at the end of my long hospital stay.
In the late spring of 19,
the family came to christmas in a bulldozer in Corning, New York, the family of six.
The few remaining temporary workers, mostly from the Philippines, crammed into the tiny hall of the antechamber of the American Consulate on the Pico Se[any] serious.
The cave, the old room, was empty, its air of summer stale and its dull gray.
A man named Kattongus was growing old.
Several months before the start of the year I was in my bedroom in Horseshoe Bay, Ontario, pretending to be dead.
Don't you ever walk alone.
It has been an interesting story.
Tombstone rose from the wet earth.
The light rain of the second week of June fell through a roseate smog of smog, little perfumed, and a heavy blanket of dark brown dust that barely concealed the smog below.
It was early in the morning, and Daddy was stretched out on the mat where the baby was.
It passed through there the Amazons, and through the United States, and across the Atlantic, and from north to south, and east to west, and from the great gulf to the isthmation, and from the great sea to the great ocean; but from the sun through the stormy storm and the rapid process of its recrossing at the end, it passed only through the weather-beaten and ruined remains of that vast empire, and into the midst of the sub-arctic wilderness, which was then the stronghold of the American continent.
A thousand years ago there was a man who lived in a house on a hill, and who had many servants, and who thought that he had all the honors of a prince, and who was entitled both to a palace and to a throne.
Mom had been sitting on the lap of my head all morning.
The great horn in the west, which must have been there somewhere, had stopped playing all day long.
It began on November 2, the same year that my father died.
No quest in this world has ever produced so many unexpected and delightful results, so many happy discoveries, and so many happy conflicts.
I will not tell you who is right.
The town was little more than a big, squalid mess near the western border of the United States.
He had also been hoping that he had died in an airplane accident.
Through the black-gray sky, low and large, swooping and chirping through the little trees of the hillside, a single white dove peered low and wide, warning of danger.
On the morning of August 21, 1885, a young woman named Laura Shuddlebuck, nineteen years old, and living in the town of Ashland, Oregon, was driving home from the hospital after a terrible accident in which she had been struck by a bus.
The cosmos, however, willed itself that the tale of the rise of the titan would be told in its own manner, and also as if it had never happened.
It began at four o'clock in the morning, and the boy who had been called to the doctor's office had apparently forgotten to take any medicine.

Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
MacBeth the Quill-Master was always in the kitchen, but he was never out of coffee.
The white brick house of the alderman's was a little more modern than most, if that's what you meant by modern.
The empty oven still hurt his eyes when he stood over the brim.
The tip of the moon illuminated the dark streets.
In the early morning, the house filled with a quickness that belied the earth's heaviness, a force that forced everything else to stand still.
"Come on, Princess." said her mother.
The sun was setting over the Sahara when a town was born.
TO THE CHILDREN I MOVE.
THIS IS MY STORY.
There was once a woman, named Alice, who lived in a small village in the heart of the forest.
THE house on Buckthorn St., St. Paul's Place, the place where the moor ended, was neither a house nor a tavern.
Everybody knew where the coach was.
The curtain of dawn rose on the fifth day of November, 1645.
I am confounded, indeed, with the strangeness of the circumstance, which has, as it were, ravaged my whole mind.
Neither the gate at the outer gate of the compound, nor the gate which led into the yard, nor the gate which led into the courtyard of any of the surrounding houses, nor the stout gate which led out of the garden of the house, nor even that gate, covered with unwholesome yellowish green grass, did seem to be proper for the purpose of the house itself.
The paladins of the Selesmere mountewell, who were often extended to all quarters of the realm, had long since grown tired of the bother of the expedition against the Ruins of Winterfell.
The fire was already burning brightly in the garden of the old house, when, by the labour of some hired hands, the ashes of an enormous oak and a birch trunk were brought in, and placed in a large gold-flowered vase, brought by several persons who were decked out in fine costume and exceedingly richly-dressed, as if they had been the ministers of the church of St. Anne, of Norwich, or even of the monastery in York, which they so highly esteemed, and so little regarded under the old church itself, of which they had both been residents and bishops, as though they had been lords themselves; and then these things were over and done with, and the house was entirely cleared of all traces of the old occupant.
THE day was bright as a henstone in the spring of the year 1644.
only to forget that I was born, I think, in 1644.
Winds were blowing on the hills on all sides, the silver peaks blazing with the bright light of the sun.
An old man in a white dress, sitting crosslegged on a damp stone floor, had a cigarette lighter in each hand, and a bundle of twigs in front of him, containing nothing but a wide-brimmed hat and a pair of straw gloves.
THE SIMILARITY of unclean and unclean-looking things is not a matter of fact, however; so much the reverse.
The throng of the audience was beginning to get restless, and it was early in the morning, with the air of a growing city, that a number of them decided to become the first to vanish.
THE death of the first king of England is far from the least of the British authorities' concerns, while it is undoubtedly the greatest of their.
It was a bright, clear day in November, and the sun was shining brightly upon the sea of stars.
Periwinkle flowers bloomed in the sunlight of the garden of a handsome young lady.
The paladins of the Selesmere mountewell had once before been engaged in the secret play of politics which is the subject of the present volume.
The former sovereign of the Crimea was a man of genius, even when he was young, and one who carried on his mind without restraint the deep doctrine of national devotion which was then in fashion.
This is the story of the Gray woman in those days when the Fox-men of the valley fought evil as well as good, and even in the darkest hours of the war, when the survival of her race depended on her keeping a close watch on her allies and her sons.
Stow, dressed in the highest style, sat down in the low dining-room of her house on the bank of the Thames.
Stow, who was accustomed to be the first one out of the house at the most inconvenient hours of the day, stood upright before her book-tables in the late afternoon, and looked round the vast space before her with the air of a man who had been long since back in England.
Near the end of
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
My name is Twilight Sparkle, beloved daughter of the Equestrian ruling class.
There is a land, somewhat distinct from the rest of Equestria, in the far north of the land.
 "So, what do you think, Rainbow?" Twilight asked.
At the beginning of spring, when the pink-and-white-striped tulpes bloomed, the earth under my feet picked through warm, green grass.
When I was just a babyball, my father gave me a pair of scissors and said, "This is your problem from now on, but I'll take care of it."
I cannot tell you how many times I've heard it said that if you teach the world how to die, it will become the best place there has ever been to live.
It was the spring of '99.
I was born in the year 1719.
It was a time of great change.
There was once upon a time, there was a land called Isreal.
The sun rose to begin its rounds.
The water was warm and murky.
One minute Ray was standing in front of his desk, examining the file he had been given.
There was once a man who knew a thing or two about magic.
"I'm going to show you some magic," said his master, "but first I need you to tell me what my name is."
The day we died was a day of terrible pain and dread.
"I don't believe in ghosts."
Twilight had just gotten off work when she was kidnapped by a shadowy figure.
"Oh..." said the pegasus, trying to remember what it was that she had been doing all morning.
When the fire-breathers went crazy for their fire-breathing twin, the sun came out on Sunday.
Pinkie pie, I think she said.
Another day, another video of Fluttershy sneaking into the Ponyville library on a crowded morning and looking for her book.
"Step forward, young pied pony," the changeling said.
This isn't about me, Rainbow Dash said.
Drake may be in the third year of his best and brightest year, but he's not going anywhere.
My name is Roxie.
The day he died, Rainbow Dash found herself in a strange land: an unfamiliar place, one she had only the vague recollection of having visited once before.
"Dooopley little jerk!"
It was a deep, dark room in a large house in the quiet valley, on a cold and stormy Monday afternoon.
My name is Rainbow Dash, and I write this just to say I won't take any more shit!
The sun is setting, and there is nothing but cold blackness and dark sky, the feel of night on one's back and chest as if you were being crushed.
"It's a Twilight gift, isn't it?"
Scootaloo kept her eyes peeled for anything out of the ordinary, but she was doing her best to ignore the odd look the look of interest was giving her.
Rainbow Dash's glance met Sky Chat with eyes as sharp and penetrating as the blade of a sword.
It is a wretched scene.
The sun peeps over the trees of the far west.
Drake sensed his mother's presence soon enough.
Sometimes, it is best to be left alone until the very last moment.
The golden white clouds of white clouds over the snows of the Pacific were the last thing he needed.
In the middle of the night that was the twentieth day of July, the startled villagers of Lonesome still whooped and hooted about the mountain, when, in fact, they were nothing at all.
The sun shone on the teeming city of New Orleans the day that the Senate granted a grant to Secretary Manger to purchase land for an oasis, a lake, and a reservoir.
It is one of the most beautiful places on the coast of Africa, for it is a port of call in all the trade of the great houses.
The sea is blue, almost black, and her dark waves glitter with a light blue colour, like the golden skin of an artist's hand.
Some time in the latter half of the eighteenth century, the old-time scoundrel Fyne, from his native village of Torralbowl, in Wales, set out to steal the title of Ruben de Vros, notwithstanding the great advantages which he had acquired by his skill in the art of card-playing.
The weather at the end of the year is very warm.
There is a mountain peak, and among its peaks, and on its range of peaks, which he called the Tomb of the Unknown, which stood at the centre of the world, and where the Great Being, the Creator of the universe, was buried.
When the queen of Equestria
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
Twilight gasped, stumbling over the sand.
I am beginning to see the forest for the trees.
I have only been with water-mists once in all my life.
I have only ever known trouble when there was more than need of it.
"When Princess Celestia ordered you to build me an ornament."
Rainbow Dash was totally not in the mood to play along with any of this. 
Rainbow Dash had never managed to get used to the idea that she had to be the only pony on the grounds or the ground in order to do anything without prompting. 
The thing about the seasons is that they're always changing.
Twilight was in her room, staring into the door. 
It was winter night, and the sleet and rain had already melted the fine snow.
"What is it, Spike?"
"I can't believe I'm pregnant again!"
Rainbow Dash was standing there, wondering how to explain her pregnancy without sounding like an idiot.
Twilight kept her hoof out of her daughter's eyes, but fished out a few strands of pony hair, like she always had.
Rainbow Dash stepped out of the greenhouse, whirled, and threw her head back.
It had been a slow winter.
Rainbow Dash had been travelling west, but her eyes had been paid to the south, where the sun shone and the air was still and fragrant, the colour of wheat or millet.
Rainbow Dash stood with her hooves on the other side of the barrier, watching the ponies through the small crack in the glass.
Rainbow Dash, on the other side of the bubble of air, watched the ponies through another small crack in the glass.
Rainbow Dash watched as her mother twisted and turned, her hooves shifting as she tried to keep the position.
Rainbow Dash passed through the thoughtless world of the Circus, eyeing the black-clad performers from the back of the coliseum.
Rainbow Dash watched as her mother twisted and turned, her hooves shifting as she tried to keep the position.
Rainbow Dash watched her mother's eyes go wide in alarm as she spun, her hooves shaking in the blackness.
Rainbower Bay, the easternmost point of the western ocean, is a city of fine old buildings and fine old houses, of fine old trees and fine old sandstones.
One warm day, over five years ago, a young man, known to all to his own ever-sorrowful surprise, came to the door of a house and entered. 
Rainbow Dash had an interesting day today.
Rainbow Dash looked around the room, carefully keeping track of the ponies present.
A pair of rounded eyes, half-moon gaze, half-horizontal slit, like a pair of scissors, stared through the kitchen.
The sky was clear: a clear blue; a thousand-yard blue.
I had finally decided to find out for sure - if I haven't already - what the Princess Foreveerether was really all about.
Twilight looked down at the floor of her hooves, at her feet, and the strands of pink hair hanging above her head.
The May sun shone as brightly as the crystal eye of the great tree, and the day was bright, beautiful, and glad.
One morning, when it was just the two of us, we decided to keep a diary.
One day we got tired of seeing the same thing every day, and decided to just do it ourselves. 
Rainbow Dash and her friends had just finished taking a trip with Rarity.
Now that you've all seen the movie, stop saying that Equestria is full of badpony.
The sun had just risen when Twilight was walking through the market.
Long, long ago, in a place called Equestria, the Princess had a dream.
My name is Maxie.
In the space of just a few days, my friends and I had grown to fifteen, and had become very well known among the crowd.
Her mind was calm and her body strong.
You know what's funny?
Eyes closed, eyes closed, body warm and ready.
In the late summer, the height of the hottest days in the state of Ohio, the fair of the Cincinnati was held on July 23.
Today I shall write down one bold plan for the good of my life, which I shall never forget.
In this story, we see how the small town of Tuskegee, Alabama, where the famous rookie team of Colonel Grey, Eisenhower, and Woolworth, was born, changed, and grew to be one of the great sporting towns of the United States.
Very early in June, when I was five years old, I took the bus from my grandmother's house, into the town where my uncle lived, on the eastern edge
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
One minute ago, the door was to the library, and the next to Applejack's wing, and the other was to the kitchen.
It was pitch-black and cold, black, and in the grip of a terrible chill.
A dark night falls in the very heart of the city.
The streets of the city are choked with the noise of an army, the sound of hooves on hooves and hooves on hooves, hooves on hooves, hooves on hooves.
It was the last night before Christmas, and the little party was to turn out for the big feast the following day.
"Open this can of peas," said my mother.
The moon rose in a flowering blue, its waxing jewel shimmering on the green water.
Applejack sat on the edge of the rocking chair, her hooves beneath her.
They were ponies that had served the Empire for hundreds of years and said they had never seen anything like it.
The scarred body lay as it had always been: a human – not a foal, but a mortal that had served in the First and Second Imperial Legions, and still lived in exile.
The power of the dark touch was great, its fates, once divine, now subject to the whims of mortal men.
The sun shone brightly on the slope of the lake.
The hoofstave of a town grocer can be seen jutting out from the slick black mud of the city.
A thick gray mist enveloped the northern wastes after the moon rose, fluttering in the wind and breaking up the sweet blue sky.
When the moon shone like a star, Quimby Stables stood his ground.
At first they said it was a dream, but it really was something completely new.
On the evening of the eighteenth day of the month of January, 1785, a drowsy young man rode into the house of Thomas Meredith, of Spitalfields—a respectable gentleman of about eighty years of age, who had resided for some years in the neighbourhood of the house, but had never been there before.
At nine o'clock that afternoon, January the 3rd, it occurred to a certain aristocrat, that there should be a public disputation within the Houses of Parliament or in the public press, relating to the only thing which was supposed to excite the interest of the people, and to possess the peculiar character of disputation, when they reached the point at which an argument almost as important as that which had been previously pendered, was to be brought before them, or rather to be submitted to them, when some one, who was at the moment about to displace a lord, suddenly appeared and asked:
The purpose of this work is to produce a report of the following year, showing, in the course of its particulars, the progress of the work of some of the distinguished artists, who have hitherto exercised their talents, or, at all events, failed to exercise them, in the new arts of art, or the old arts of science, in the reign of Charles I.
The palace of the king of England, where the queen lived, was at a certain range of the river Eel, which bounded on either side the flats of the great plain, and seemed to be of ever-changing extent.
The sunshine began to wash through the trees with the softness of a spring day; but even then the air that the trees breathed was still with a more disagreeable air, with a certain preservative, if not disagreeable odour, than was usual.
The moon shone like a golden lamp, and shone so brightly, that it was able to obscure the sun, even in the dim light of the dark time of the year.
The church door was open and the light of the sun shining; and it was found that, at any rate, the king was not present.
Sometime in the year 1146, as I remember, a certain Ralph 3rd son of Charles 2nd, was sitting at the breakfast table, among his brothers, after the feast, when the words, "What a disconcerting apparitions! what a disturbance!" were spoken by some one; and immediately the whole family rushed out of the room.
The twinkling of the moon in the east.
For a long time, perhaps ever since the day this magical book was written, there has existed in the City of Rome, a certain market-town upon the banks of the Tiber, named in honour of the famous Lycian-maiden of the river, Dace, who had the honour of having escorted her father, Hercule the Long-winded, through the dangers of dangerous combat, and found success, from the most desperate circumstances, in the restoration of ancient peace and tranquillity; and also for a long time, perhaps ever since the day this book was written, there had been

"Mar-Tes-Twilight!"
I am a destitute orphan living in a time of dire need, reduced to a mere child by the evil queen, who had her own plans for me.
One morning, Rarity woke up and the sky was black and dark, the wind howling, the sea-trolls sent into a frenzy.
I was born a child.
Political corruption is an ugly thing.
Night after night, the senate and house of commons have been thronged with citizens, eager to get their say behind the bill that would make them common citizens of the Kingdom of Corona.
We have nothing to be afraid of, ma'am.
Great magic, but nothing to get very excited about.
Princess Celestia had been very pondering how to spend the week before wearing her crown.
To my relief, my teacher, I did not find the Professor Sibylla.
The evening sun shone brightly, the trees in the park churned with the gentle wind, and the sun was shining long, bright and bright.
It was the day before the beginning of summer, and the snow-white little foals on a white-barked white-canopy had finally begun to take flight, the few that had not already begun to flee in terror.
I was born into the world.
I take my cue not from my father's voice, though I do remember distinctly the voice.
Once upon a time...
In the middle of August and the last of its kind, the icy north was bitterly cold and snowy, and the minnows had fled.
Every night the crowd assembled in the square before the square at midnight, but that was the only thing that was known to the real people of this part of Norway.
On a single clear autumn day in the year 1769, the great general and principal of the army of the English crown, by the advice of the Privy Council, and by the order of the Privy Council, as they were called, the late great general, Captain Henry Fairfax, presided in council over that brigade, which, in the name of the king, and of the public, was now called that of the regiment of the most distinguished gallants of the army of England, in the midst of that district of the city, which was called the city of the Privy Council.
The order of the nobility was then, as it is now heretofore, standing this day, at the threshold of court, towards Henry the Second, king of the United and Great Commonwealth of Australia.
The girl had rup­tured, the brainless, stupid, hopeless, hopeless, willful lay, who had enjoyed the young prince of Wales his first fondness for her, had accepted him as her husband.
When the war was over, the king of the United and Great Commonwealth of Australia, up-to-the-nth-of-a-mighty-pound silver rupee, with twenty-two thousand pounds' worth of gold, twenty thousand pounds' worth of silver, had shrunk into a trifle less than an oblong-faced old man, with a middle-aged face and a boyish air, and a small body; and that little porcupine had shrunk from all that was possible into a little more than a nose and a mouth.
My name is Colonel Peter Housley and I am a colonel of the British army; I am a boy I know very well.
That is the story of my childhood and my life, and I hope it may be useful to you.
The wind howls and the sun shines like a dying star.
In the year 1769, the Lord of the Commons, by the order of the Privy Council, the late late Lord Fairfax, presided in council over that brigade, which, in the name of the king, and of the public, was now called that of the regiment of the bravest gallants of the army of the crown, in the midst of that district which was named the city of the Privy Council.
The eve of the week was warm and the air of Yorkshire and Devon was of the fresh, bracing kind and pleasant.
The month is single, the year is single, the year is single, and we live in a single year, when it is great joy to live.
It is a month of extreme hardship for the widow of the old wizard, and the reader cannot possibly be surprised by the scene which I have set before him.
The bad luck followed that which did follow all luck; for the moment that the old wizard was away, his widow was already in great trouble, for her husband had been away all year, and his old friend had been away for a long time, and there was no man of any importance in the world to help her; and it was all very well to have a friend to

Marek was on his way to work when news of his daughter's death spread like wildfire. 
“I’m going to write a novel.”
“It wasn't me.”
“I'm going to write a book of lyrics.”
“Everything I’m gonna write, I just wanna tell you about it,” wrote the kindly old-time poet Anson Erdbruck, in his notes of a joke.
“I am a dirty old man, but I’m 100% certain I have the wherewithal to write a book!”
“In the very beginning, there was the Screaming Cat, and it was an awful lot of noise.”
“This is what happens when you eat a new sort of fruit, Allen, a new sort of dessert and a new sort of juice, and a pecan and a cinnamon roll.”
The night the moon turned into a red giant star, the moon was full of stars.
The universe is full of stars.
It was a good day then.
The night they washed the cathedral floor in the dead of night and put the last of the black ladies in the corner, the night what was to be a very long painful life was drawing to a close in Dublin.
My father used to say that a great deal is said about the most important people in the world.
February full of green leaves, with the leaves as thick as a man's fist.
I drink tea.
"So what are you doing now?"
"I'm going to read a book," said the girl in the green coat.
“A book,” I said, waving a book at the steerswoman.
The sun rose early and set late.
“We're going to do it again,” my father said.
The unicorn parasols hung down high on the wall, and on one side of which was a tall column of air-powered suns, on the other a low column of sky of stars.
“Go,” said the small men in the dark.
The gold-green sky was alive with the sound of the wind and the scrape of hooves in the hot mud of the Gully. 
"New York!"
The phone rang.
So we're doing our honeymoon with the girl we called Ella, and now we're having some great adventures together.
The wind howls in the forenoon.
Permanent abattoirs are silent places, quiet places at that.
I heard a scream.
The muddy water slipped from the tip of the golden street, and across the border to the desert of the Pit.
The cat was all right.
Been here recently.
“Was it you,” said the woman at the end of the card table.
The feast of the night fell near as soon as the sun had set.
When I was in my seventies, my parents had a house in a small hamlet, the oldest and the least comfortable of any family in Scotland.
The first time I heard any one talk about the end of the world, I was in a coma.
The light world stretched like a tapestry on the blackening earth.
In the early spring of 1824, a little girl was born into the family of Mr. Henry Arundel.
Mortimer Arundel was an English nobleman, born in a land of great magnificence and tradition; and it was by no means unusual for a boy of seventeen to bring about the death of his father or stepmother either at the time of marriage or of death.
On the night I leave this place, I shall be arrested.
There was once a time, and perhaps not till very recently, when it was not difficult to find out what was going on in a house or a country house, you would not have been quite a fool to take your servant's hand and shake it all round in your hands.
The moon is smiling upon the town.
The great flood of the year 1835 was terrible enough.
The sky was like a whirlwind, its swirling masses of dust and ash.
I had the great misfortune to be born in a time when destruction was everywhere.
There was once a time when the little green island of Avalon lay at the entrance to a vast ocean.
Night is the only known time of the year when the moon does not rise.

The sun was fading from the sky, and even Celestia had trouble getting a good angle.


Skelly had nothing to do but play with his pony's tail.


They'd met before. But because their names were Celestia and Spike, they had something in common.


My name is Sam Stone.


A bright white star, freshly lit against the gray sky, shimmered like a mirror.


The earth shook.


Spike sprawled on the floor, feathers in a hot summer breeze.
In the twilight of the day, hoof prints punctuated the broad, dark squares of the town of Sandpoint.


On the sixth day of June, 18:20, a solitary missile-ship passed through the atmosphere of the planet Pegasi, carrying men and equipment for the contribution of the Committee to the promotion of science and art in the ancient world and for the general welfare of mankind.
Dust swirled in the dark.
The girl was there.
On the fifth day of July, 18:02, a strange black-eyed boy with a beard and a moustache and a short mustache was born in the city of Trebon.
In the very first day of the fifteenth century, a creature with wildly and wildly long legs and a winged trunk entered the world, and had all the gaiety and fashions of a cat, except that it had paws and wings altogether.
The wind in the valley was blowing fiercely, and the rain of fifty to sixty inches hung heavy on the hills; but what a sight to behold, when the treetops whirled and bobbed like a pair of spinning tops, or, at best, like a pair of tiny twigs; two or three inches in diameter.
The sky was illuminated by a brilliant brilliance which beamed out its purest light.
I am a star.
The sky was full of stars.
Glittering with the colors of magic, the white-crowned cyborg blinked widely, as though he were trying to find the light.
He was Princess Elinor of Thanetstern.
In the morning, when our ponies were laden with their food and with their clothes, we were to wake up in the bookroom and read the morning paper.
The rain began to fall, and it was very cold, snowing, and very wet.
No one wants to live forever.
When effects are a consideration rather than a necessity, I am of opinion it may be expedient to choose an object of possible apparent importance, and to determine what the necessary powers of representation, efficiency, and expediency of manufacture may afford.
It was the greatest tale of all time.
It was a beautiful day, and cold and windy and very windy, on the fifth of September, in the year 1814.
The wind blew, and the clear, clear, quiet days of every unseasonable year brought out the best colours in the plumage of the colts.
It was not, however, to be expected.
The sky was grey with the unmistakable marks of the grim politics of the Old Republic, and the weather was a deep, rumbling, shivering shade of grey.
I said, Joe, that I would not have you carry a gun.
It was the first morning of our marriage, and the moon was rising over the river Thames.
The sun rose and looked back at the city of London, as if it were a great, heavy beast.
It was a dark and stormy day.
The younger of the two sisters was wealthy, and possessed of a large house.
He was born a fool.
When I first came to the world, I said I would never read a book, and that I would do whatever someone told me.
The morning sun shone brightly, but it was a day of rain.
The sun was shining when I stepped into the room.
The cock cackled, and the lightning flashed once, twice, thrice in the darkness of the early morning.
The sun was shining, white in the Tirmones' garden.
It was a cool morning, and the sky was clear, clear as a glass.
I am in love, Jack.

I am not a human being.

And it is.
I cannot tell you how many times I think:

But I can tell you that I am quite certain this is the biggest life-changing idea you ever had.

The U-Boat crash into the moor (the story goes, as per the account of the author who stayed up all night to write it, that he had heard first of it from a friend of his who had been aboard the pretty old ship which was in the course of its voyage, when he saw a ship that unlike her, was large, and that it was covered with a mantle of splinters, and in which he thought it possible the corpse of a man, but who had been murdered in some strange way, might have come.

There was a man who loved his brother, but was not sure he loved him.

There was no space for a human being inside the mind of the thing-that-is-not-a-thing, but it is very probable that everybody had some idea of what it was.

The wind is howling and the earth is shaking, and then there is nothing.
The morning dust settled on the sparkling white brims of the ruddy sky, and we stood out among the stars.
The sun rose early in the spring and set late in the fall.
Personal History – Abridged, New England citizens of the year 1700. I was born in a remote part of the country where the weather was like the weather of the United States of America and the language like that of anybody who ever lived there, except perhaps the inhabitants.
I am thirty-two years old, and I began to wear a lot of clothes in the last year of my life.
It is always a mistake.
It was a stubbornly hot day in June when I could not even take care of my own house or my own car.
The story would begin with a dream.
It was a bleak, bad, swampy, dark-worn day in June, five hundred and fifty-three years ago, when, heading northwest on the high desert front of Mexico, I paddled on over the Rio Grande and came upon a town called Platt, which the travellers had called "the abode of the gods" or "the palace of the gods."
With a thud, the carriage screeched to a halt.
When we came to the house, the day was calm and quiet.
At sixteen-and-a-half years old, the youngest of the little girls, I had invented my own career: the trouble was, I had never thought of it before, because I had never seen anyone who had been born before the middle of a hard and arid year, run a respectable business.
The young poet had been waiting for the moment, talking to her grandfather, when it would happen: here were her feet, well-nigh barefoot, with their unkempt, patchy hair, and her hands folded under the lids, as if she had been carrying them for some months, so that her hands should have a little more room, and her fingers a little less clumsy, than when she was twelve.
In the year when the tower-mounds lay spread across the water, in the grip of a hurricane, in the midst of a sea of debris and dying ships, the sun stood still, gloomy.
The name of the town is now unknown to the public.
When they had laid waste the village, when they had plundered the great house where the Tuatha de'Dal lived and raised their temple, Wren by Wren, and the poor aunt who was their sister-in-law, they had no less than four hundred and fifty acres of land, which they called Elmore, or Conylymore, or, in the neighbourhood of the old house, Elmore Quail's, or otherwise known as the Pond, or the Pond on the Poontail, or as the Pond on the Poontail, or at least as Elmore Quail's Pond, or as the name suggests, by the name of such a place as this.
The day I was born, my brother, James, did not know how to run a ship, or how to hold down a livelihood on his own account.
The east wind blew, stained grey and dusty with the blood of soldiers, across the crescent of wintry dust, drove back the creeping light from the whirling dust.
One morning in September, when the man, named Charles, was six years old, a deep snowdrift laid bare the narrow streets of the village, where the street lights glittered in the dim dim moonlight of the summer evening, and the name of the place, with its quaint and quaint old houses and its neat little garden,

Thirteen thousand years ago, the earth was a single thing.
Today, I am at the centre of a terribly complicated, interlinked world.
The first thing I remember is being born.
The second thing I remember is being on the ocean.

In that year of hobby, when my friends and I sat on the lawns of the half-empty houses and had a good old time, there stood a woman with blue eyes and a blue-green dress and great big black heels.
It was a bright and sunny day in the spring of nineteen forty.
"What do you want from me, Salome?"
It was, apparently, October 26, that a young man of forty-five died in a car accident that took place on the Manhattan high-speed line.
It was a nice day in the winter of nineteen forty.
It was the day that the moon was made to curve over the city.
The snow-creaming leaves were followed by the first dark snow that had fallen since the fall of nineteen forty.
It is difficult to evade the fact that a vast city lies before you on the horizon.

There was no doubt in either the mind of the spectator or the mind of the scientist or the ear of either that the 16th -century astronomer, M.J.S. Tannenby, was right when he said that a planet orbits a sun.
Well, it is the only thing I can think of that can truly be termed a con-king.
God knows where it is, but if it is not here, it must be long gone.
According to the familiar earth-system theory, the heavens must have been green with the blood of every living thing living on this planet, since all the animals knew what it was like to die.

In the eagerness of her youth, Celestia had known exactly what she was destined to become.
History has no beginning; it is, as all such things do, a history of the beginning, which, though it begins in the beginning, is not the beginning at all, though it begins in the beginning; but it begins, as it were, with the beginning, by the beginning, with the beginning.
The Wasteland of the Mojave was not a desert or a swamp, nor was it a patch of barren earth, nor was it any stretch of uninhabited land, but it was, on the contrary, with all these qualifications in view, that the traveller at first sight-landed himself in the midst of a great and curious country, which was bounded on every side by rapids, and ravines, and swamps, and many other such rugged and desolate airs.
Serene, but not unsightly.
One day, while watching her blank expression as it was reflected in a mirror, Princess Celestia thought to herself, "I quite like it quite a bit. How am I going to wear it without looking like an idiot!"
This is where the story begins!

In her younger and more vulnerable years, Luna had never held a weapon above her head.
For a moment, everyone sat in silence.
Pinkie Pie had seen the white sapland before, but she hadn't known what it was, or why people did what they did.
Good evening, birds of a feather and noisome beasts of the night.
The sun rose into the sky as the first dark clouds of the summer began to move into the west.
The ponies had been lucky in the past.
Lumiere was tired of having to watch as the sun rose, sunlit and golden.

Titan stood on the ledge of the blackened hills and watched his father's enormous creations, the Titans.

An eternian pony with platinum white irises and a veneer of gentleness, Twilight Sparkle sat down in a court of mirrors and stared into the distance, unable to stop smiling.

Pinkie Pie sat on the floor of her hoof, frowning at what was left of her new apple.
Pinkie Pie rose from the chair and stretched.
Rainbow Dash reached down and grasped Pinkie's hoof.
After a long and difficult night, Rainbow Dash awoke in the middle of the night to the sound of trumpets, the sound of threats and of deep and solemn sighs.
The white hull of a seven-masted sailing ship floated through the open skies.
The Great White One watched over the land of Equestria with his serene gaze and the lighthearted worry in his eyes.
The White Nose feathers burned a brilliant orange in the heat of the day.
Skywrite, a white-tailed white-tailed Pembroke's peregrine falcon, was perched in her perch on the port bow of the vessel, watching the sun set over the waters of the Great Sea.
The sun rose brightly and bitterly in the port of Yument, as if it were the sun rising every day.
For as long as she could remember, her father had been the only person she knew who had ever understood her whole personality better.
I have always felt that I must be of some use to the court of the emperor.

Rainbow Dash leaned over the counter and checked the time.
Pinkie Pie sat on a cardboard box in her hooves and looked up at the stars and the sky.
The sun rose early on a Sunday morning, and the clouds seemed to have melted.
The world was small, but one mile wide and one mile high, as if it had been born out of nothing.

Maurice the carpenter had spent the morning over work.
Draven Howler has been hunted and slayed.
"It's a good thing you hate flying."
Three and a half hundred ponies, then.
It was a dreary day.
The sun shone brightly.
§The ultimate question of life is whether you will find happiness, or whether you will find death.
The air around the moon grew cloudy and the air in the air around Ponyville was beginning to feel colder.
In the beginning when the universe was but one and a half trillion years old it was all there was and was all that was.
"Ponyville is getting pretty crowded."
The day before my eighteenth birthday, the air in Ponyville was blue as the paint on a dead body.
My name is Princess Cadence the Queen of Hearts and Ladies and Stormcloak and Sparing the Law of the Sea for the crime of picking on a majestic crown princess…
When Rarity had agreed to marry my cousin Sugilite Diab and had given me permission to wear the wedding dress, I had arranged a private party for the two of us.
“Close the door,” said Fluttershy.
I have been waiting for this moment for as long as the earth and I know how long.
I knew when I heard the news of my father's death that I would have to put a stop to my father's plans.
My name is Rarity Teal, Princess of the Honorable Order of the Sun.
This is the story of a girl who dropped out of high school and had to learn to fly while trying to find a job.
When ponies count the final swan, the day begins right where the sun rises for the first time in two thousand years.
Looking out my window from the hoof of my horse, Twilight said, "You're growing a lot older, Applejack."
Pinkie Pie was sitting in the living room of her house in the suburbs of Ponyville, the fresh air of her fresh-pitch garden bringing out blue-green flowers that bloomed all afternoon and remained crisp and green all night.
Twilight looked over the balcony at the endless blue sky, filled, in her opinion, with the most beautiful white foals, and sighed.
My name is Applejack, Princess of the Starry Skies.
When you're fourteen, you're practically a princess.
Applejack always knew there was another side to her ponyfriend. 
“Stop it,” said Applejack, good-naturedly. "You're breaking my heart right now."
For a moment I could not remember what my father had done to make me stand out.
“This is the crazy part.” said Fluttershy.
My name is Rainbow Dash. 
“I don’t like to use words.” said Applejack.
“What are you talking about?” said Twilight, exasperatedly.
Sweetie Belle was sitting on her bed, knitting a sweater for Applejack of the Rainbow Dash. 
“You'd better go home,” said Applejack.
“I didn't share a room with your mom or your brother or any of that stuff that everybody does.” said Rainbow Dash, turning her chair around to face the floor.
“NOW, now, all right?” said Rainbow Dash, shaking her stork.
"You're the sun," said the Great and Terrible moon, "not me."
“Your mother did not ask you to do anything,” said Applejack, and it was not a question she had thought about thoroughly, much less questioned.
“I didn’t come out of the desert for no good reason,” said the Great and Terrible moon, as the words struck up in her throat.
The moon was covered with sparkling sun.
“Why are you going through these keepsakes?” said Rainbow Dash as she and her hooves examined the old little book that lay before her.
When she woke, she wakened up as she always did.
“Now,” said Applejack, as she sat down in her chair.
“What were you thinking,” said Twilight, frowning for a moment. 
“What was it you were thinking,” said Sweetie Belle.
“I should've said no,” said Applejack, as she looked down at her hooves.
“Here we are,” said the Duchess of Ama.
“So is my gold eyeball,” said Princess Cadence.
The wind howled, screaming in
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
Amy had never met a man who wasn't a human.
The city was filled with a different kind of beauty.
The cloud of dust drifted slowly, with the sound of the water as its only source of vibration, through the blackened sky.
The house where Rarity had lived with her family had stood empty from the start.
Some people who use magic have this uncanny ability to transform the most mundane objects of their lives into magical objects in their own minds.
Every day there was a story to tell.
"This is not a dream at all."
"Hurry up, Time Is on my side!"
The gate of the palace was ajar, but Kayla frowned.
When they had taken the gun from the sniper, the last remaining wild boars had gone into the house and hid in the living room.
Most people thought it was a horrible, ugly thing.
The black clouds of the sea of Equestrian beauty had turned a deep blue when, for a moment, the glittering banks of the river stood yet as it was always there, a green and a silver and a white and a brown.
The sun had risen as It always had at the start of spring, but Twilight had already begun to feel tired.
The grass was green, and the weather was warm, and the air was the smell of green pastures and pasture land.
"You are the best Alicorn in Equestria. You do not like the weather?"
The sun had set, and the northern sky was as blue and white as the day the Fluttershy family left Ponyville.
My name is Amelia, and I am the daughter of a seafaring nobleman.
Marek was smiling when he said to Twilight, "I would like to introduce you to Cadence."
Twilight had been so anxious for him to take her first flight she had not known until that moment that the spell they were about to cast was for something else altogether.
I knew it would happen sooner or later.
The opening credits of the year nineteen were rolling.
You're going to have to wait long enough to find out exactly what happened.
The old man had a pair of wings, two big ones each, and they were blue.
Rainbow Dash was laughing so hard she seemed to think she was dead.
After Bilbo Baggins had been hanged, the dwarves had arranged for the bodies to be hoisted up and placed in a tower on the top of the mountain that stood before the entrance to Hobbiton.
Twilight had the gift of prophecy.
As everything which ever happened to the protagonists of this story has already come to light, the idea of the Elements is no longer confined to the realm of phenomena, but the general direction of development of reality.
The White Room.
The plane had stopped in an empty part of the desert, 3,000 feet, six miles above the earth.
Fluttershy sat cross-legged on the landing, staring at the crystal-clear sky.
The high school track meet was beginning to wind down.
Him... he! He... is!
The cold wind of winter blew past, churning the warm soil, as if it had just been thrown in.
The pale moon shone brightly, peering down on the broken black of the city of Timber Bay.
All the dry stone windows of the cabin were boarded up, save one.
When the summer sun rose the first warm wind stirred the endless lands.
It is a day once, of course, when the Kooran—or Kooran's, for that matter—have no choice but to claim their title.
The game was a little over, but it was that moment when the sun was going round and round and finally came to rest and when the sky once more seemed to be teeming with life and motion, that caused all games to stop and all runners to stop.
It is a little over a year since the whole story began.
Sometime around the year sixteen-eight the first episode of the first series of King's Adventures in Amber was broadcast on Radio West Coast.
In the year fourteen-four, a young man named John Bunyan died.
On a certain day in April, 1828, the family of Mrs. Sarah Smith, of Pembroke Place, were sent to their brother's house at the hand of the Earl of Northampton, in the neighbourhood of Huntingdon, to receive the death of their aunt.
In a certain day in the year of grace, 1844, there appeared, in a book which, as yet, had not been found worthy of mention, the memoirs of the late George the Fourth, Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and his early family, who, with many of their kin, had reached the height of fame and fortune, by virtue of their service in the service of their
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
Ebony and horn-rimmed glasses.
Nothing but clouds.
The sun dipped into the prosperous thirty-degree swamp, and the trees were all but bare, the waters eating at their branches and leaving only the shallowest patches of bare earth.
I was nineteen years old, and I was pregnant, and my friend Carrot Top had a crush on me.
"I take it you have not had much practice with magic of late, have you?"
The stallion turned suddenly, to see the voice behind the left-hand wheel of his horse.
I am telling you, we weren't joking.
"Sir?"
"I was just thinking," said the looking-glass.
The story of the building, however, cannot be told without taking into account the circumstances in which it was constructed.
When Applejack woke up she was so excited she hadn't even remembered what had happened the night before. 
The morning sun shone brightly on the equator, as in other summers when it warmed the temperature at the equator so much that the sun shone long and dark, casting shadows on the sea floor.
It wasn't certain when the Princess Celestia would ever discover that her cousin, Princess Luna, had tried to kill her.
After my mother died, I had an idea. 
Once upon a time, there was a princess, and she wasn't supposed to be alive.
It was at the beginning of May, that my grandfather discovered a girl in a bag of ancient moon dust.
"This is a letter," said the write, "from Miss Victoria, Princess of the Golden Horse."
It was a cold, windy evening.
"It's a cold dead end," said the horse-driver as he put up the last of the last of the white slacks that covered the back of the carriage.
The sky was blue as a sable string, and blue as the waters in Loch Ness.
I tell this story to honour my grandfather, who took me to see the sun.
I was born in a field of corn, on the banks of the Mississippi, in the year 1812, to parents who were in the habit of asking questions of their children. 
A boy who never left the house and who never knew his mother or father but herself, went to school in the morning to learn how to read and write.
It was the end of August, and the white house stood silent.
I was born on the site of the present site of Boston, on the river Charlestown, in the year 1815, to parents who were citizens of the city of Boston. 
Here's the story of my grandmother:
It was the morning of the morning the shooting started, and Sir C. Marlons was sitting by the fire in the west garden of the hotel.
The two seats in the front row of the theatre stood empty, their empty as their occupants. 
I sat on the ground in front of the tables, as my friend Dr. Langer opened the book of the chapter on antiquity and carefully flicked through the pages.
A little further down the road, in the road that was never quite straight, was the city of Mount Vernon.
I remember at the age of four, holding a drawn pen in my hands, that it was my intention to write a poem.
We were sitting in the hall of one of the houses on the east side of the river when the door opened.
The little cottage was in the pleasant garden of the village.
The time passes like a dream
I am standing in the middle of the river, which is now called the St. Mary's of God; and, as I look down the bank of the sea, I see the hills of the west, at the distance of a great distance, and I do not know whether I have seen them before.
There was once a man who was of a noble family, from low birth; he was named John.
The great city of London was as one who had never been dreaming of anything else, as one who had never been able to conceive of anything else.
Some years ago, I went to see Mrs. Davy, the famous lady of the house, who was in the habit of calling her that; but that name had quite a curious meaning to me, as I had been accustomed to hear her use it when I went into a room where she lived with her friends and relatives.
When the sun rose, day was clear, low clouds of blue across the sky overhead, and the little water-coloured ship which stood on the river Thames, which was called the Spray, was sailing through the bay like a mighty whirlwind.
It was a hot summer day in July, that Mr. Wynand, a gentleman of the house, who had painted the rooms of several distinguished persons, and was highly respected by all, was out at the house
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.


Orange is most commonly the colour of the longest wind.


Times change, and what was last year's story is not always the only one of its kind.


Dust settles on the dusty surface of the world...


The first thing I remember is not knowing my name.
"Pull up."
"Eh?"
"Hold on a second."
"Greetings, stand by and watch."
"Mother was very scared."


Time is travelling through the Freelancers' past.


The great plain of Golgah stood as the boundary between the world of the living and the world of the dead.
Now that the sun has set and the occasional bird of grass has settled with its shade, smoke seeps from tree boughs and pastures and piles of dried grass and weeds into the vast air of the wide pastures beyond the darkening peaks.
It was here, the spring of 2000.
Sunday ran as usual in the sea of dark.
Behind the ring of white-fringed trees that framed the port of new-haven stood an old man with white hair and a beaming face.
Glimpses of white curling from the cracks in the earth toward the sky.
In the streets of New-heaven lies a city on earth--a city that was once a land in which an intelligent man named Adam was born and died, and which in its modern form has been called the City of the Stars.
One day on the day when the sun disappeared into the cosmos, the great body that was known to mankind as the sky, or the universe, came to life anew, from the deep of space.
Walking along the empty streets of New-Heaven, one would have thought that the city was a quiet town.
The winds of winter blow in from the east, blowing the dark folds of earth toward the sky in ever-shifting sheets of snow.
There was once, when the stars were young, a palace where the king lived and the princess played.
There was once a village of no name where, for many years, the people lived in peace with one another and the land was rich in pastures and streams and lakes.
New-Heaven.
In the time when the inhabitants of the Sunny Isles were still calling it "the Isle of Whales," there was a beauty in a sea of sorrow and ruin.
Some say the sun came out of darkness.
In the year that the stars were young, in the time when men were still calling it "the Isle of Whales," there was a tree on a hillside, which had a great habitation for its apex.
New-Heaven, the faraway island of the northern seas, a island of clouds of ice where the most stormy seas meet, a world of quiet and calm calm seas, where the fair weather was never seen in a storm, a world of silent islands where the living were always full of adventure, a safe harbour of the most prosperous kind, where commerce was normally carried on with a view to the export of useful things and to the profit and enjoyment of the low and middle classes of the West Indies, a place of great wealth and a very fortunate situation in all things, a most curious place indeed, where it was generally the custom for a white ship to come that sailed through the main of the harbor for a port called Port Royal, where the merchant remained until she had been able to settle down in a secluded laird's house.
I am now in my seventeenth year.
In a town of only one thousand and eighteen inhabitants, the town of Earlscastle, a man named John Dodd, came to live.
Samuel was telling the story of the voyage of discovery of the mariners of the ninth abbacy to the island of Martinique.
The sun is nearly setting, and if it should rise in the same place for more than a few minutes the whole sky would be dark and dismal as if the moon had been black and dead.
What a fascinating world of wonders that we live in!
The day after the sunset, the most famous treasure of the London treasure-house was brought into the hall of Miss Marple.
The air is cold.
Once upon a time, when the world was young, a lad named Michael was walking home one cold Thursday evening in August, and he came upon a little stone church on a green and flowery street, or in better letters Rickson, on the south side of that city, in which the main thoroughfares led down to the narrow streets and galleries of the lower part of the town.
A young quadriplegic boy, called 'Mickey,' in my modest opinion, was walking home in his own shoes, with his hat on, from the back of the church, where he had been having the rough passage due to him, and which was

In the morning.
Mystery eyeing.
In the morning.
Do you have any idea how long it took to write this thing?
Today is Friday.
"It's the weather we love, isn't it?"
In the morning.
The future peeps out from beneath the clouds and shows you exactly what's in store.
Sunlight glittered on the water's surface, tracing the beads of the shea clouds, and I could see the shadow of a man running beside it, a small, dark-haired man, barely five feet two, wearing a light-colored shirt and red shorts with a large belt at his waist, and carrying a brown, white, and blue-colored umbrella.
I watched my sister die a horrible death.
I should have known better than to go through with it.
The sun rose steadily that day.
I put my hoof on the floor, and the water went out.
My name is Rainbow Dash.
I am the greatest fluttering of feathers, the greatest floating of clouds, and the greatest thing in the world!
My name is Oogie, and I was born to be a flutter of feather, a cloud of air, and a floating cloud of air, and a floating cloud of air, with the airspeed of a train, and the speed of a cloud, and the strength of a bull, and the strength of a man, and everything else you will ever need or care to know about flutter, one flutter all at once!
I heard her scream.
I nearly died when I was born.
The world is but a dream.
I am a man who has gone far beyond the grave.
It was autumn in the year we called Xeyn, and my father was not pleased.
I am glad to say that we are able to write to you.
The Emperor of the Day, who, according to the law of physics, died in the year of five thousand eight hundred and two, gave to his son the title of Emperor, and naturally this title made him powerful, and this powerful so that he could make a bargain with anybody.
There is nothing more beautiful than the view of a summer morning.
My name is Pinkie Pie, and I am the sweet nargle.
The child in the cell had been playing for hours, and the time had come for him to break out of his gloomy cell and play.
The day that this story begins was the first day of October, and the sun shone brightly.
My name is Applejack, and I am a great-great-granddaughter of Appleditch.
Even though they knew each other by their initials or nicknames, when the time came for the ponies to shine their lights on the new sofas and mattresses in the new barrack, they had not considered it necessary to carve words into the mahogany walls, or even to declare themselves by their first names.
It was a beautiful day in Ponyville, twilight setting behind the gleaming turrets of the royal palace.
The sun, shining from the windows of cloud-borne ships, shone brightly upon the sandy shore of the Mediterranean.
The sun rose, the rain came down, and the day was clear and a glorious sight to behold.
The day that this story begins, the sun rose for a brief moment, and then it was gone.
A chill breeze blew from the desert southwest, blowing snow from the tundra and blowing leaves of nipa, throwing them deep into the soft earth.
Twilight shook her head and sent a gentle, sinking beam of red light across the smooth white ground.
Rainbow Dash was in the kitchen preparing the morning meal for the new year's party.
Rainbow Dash thought she could hear the water moving up from the lake.
Rainbow Dash had been through so much, so many times, that she'd reached the point where she'd stopped caring what happened to her.
Rainbow Dash sat on the edge of the lake, smoking a cigarette.
Rainbow Dash took a deep breath before speaking to the next-door neighbor.
Rainbow Dash stopped smoking and looked up from the book she was reading.
The sun was up again, and Luna Eclipsis was in bed.
The summer air of the Crown Reach was crisp and fresh, and magic was calling to the life around.
It was Christmas morning in Equestria, and this was not your usual morning for the little filly Mare.
Rainbow Dash sat in the back seat of her pink and white pony wagon and watched the clouds drift away.
Two or three alicorn were seen flying across the desert.
Luna had always wished she had been born in a different time and place.
The clouds parted and I could see the stars above with an alicorn's naked eye.
An alicorn peered
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
Charon, a half-moot of a elf, was sitting on a hillside.
Mamma went to school.
The distortion—this prime mover and shaker in the universe—was in motion, as a living being, waiting for the moment of truth.
The stars, that pinkball of magical chemistry that shone like diamonds, twirled, their light dribbling, the thin stars of Natal floating among the white turquoise of the sky.
He sat and watched the sun go down slowly, with his eyes closed.
"How the hell am I going to show you the way out of mine?"
"You're going to put me in a long-term care home, aren't you?"
One morning, as the sun was leaking its last faint rays, Tia heard the bell ring, and while she was still in the kitchen preparing the breakfast that she'd have for her grandkids for the holidays, she wasn't looking out of the kitchen window.
I was the youngest of seven children; my father's wife was the oldest.
You know that you can't really do anything right until you reach the middle of your twenties.
It was dinner time for a couple of hours when the doorbell rang, and the blonde woman came to the door to discover that her husband had just drowned.
It was that rainy morning in July, that Isabella was watching over her new house.
The moon, for some reason, seemed to be starting to go out of focus.
The day before the death of Fluttershy, the Apple family was living in a cottage, on a farm in the mountains east of the town.
At first, the day was a lie.
We're decent, regular citizens of Ponyville, the inhabitants of which are at all times interested and cheerfully willing to accommodate the whims of the public, and to provide for the general welfare.
At first, the rain didn't stop and it didn't stop.
Raindrops were falling.
Twilight was sitting on her book, the one she'd always been short on.
Rain was falling and it was coming harder.
Rain was falling and it was coming faster.
Rain had come early enough in the morning that it shimmered in the rigid with which the air has hardened over the past months.
"Torzgon."
The night air was filled with the smell of life.
Rain had come early enough in the morning that it shimmered in the rigid with which the air has hardened over the past months.
Rain was falling and it was coming harder.
Rain was falling and it was coming faster.
In the years that followed the city of Equestrian, rain would fall consistently and steadily.
Rain was falling and it was coming steadily.
Rain fell.
It was early in the afternoon when the day of the tragedy finally arrived.
"Rain!"
Rain was falling and it was coming steadily.
The wind howled.
Rain rolled down a hillside and it didn't stop.
Rain fell and it was falling more and more slowly.
The sun rose early in the morning, in a great display of good luck, and the town of Canterlot was far from better.
Rain came last, and it was not the worst of rain in all the Equestrian countryside.
Rain was falling, falling fast.
Sunflowers flooded the streets of the small community of Minter's Ford; the earliest flush of the season was seen under the trees on the east side of the road.
In the year of the pines the first spark of hope came out of the region of Orion—Quartey, the great sage, who led the people of the region in the good times of old; and, this being the year, he told how the gods had told him to track down the drowned city of Orion.
Rain was falling and it was falling slowly and steadily.
Rain fell, falling faster.
"Sweet jade, bright one, bright one, you'll do as I say."
Rain fell with a heavy, squally thud and came away in a heap of silver dust, drifted through the air, and settled by the shores of a lake.
Now to the question of whether it is not possible to make a man evil, I answer that it is impossible.
It was that afternoon that the title-page of the Tribune-Clay came into my office and said in large letters, "NEW STATION DIRED."
Rain had come early enough in the morning that it shimmered in the rigid with which the air has hardened over the past months.
Now, I believe, there is no whit but rain in the world, nor any queer weather.
For the longest time, if I remember right, I was a very weak-minded young man, even I shall not know how old.
Rain
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
That's why they're over here gabbling and stuttering like they've never been heard of before.
The sky over the capital was a vast silver tangle of stars.
The sun was just coming up, but still it was cold and gray.
Fluttershy was sitting up straighter than usual.
It was a golden day and the evening had just begun to seem more like a kind of holiday than anything else.
"Radlar?" said a voice in the hall behind Rainbow Dash.
Everyone was still asleep.
"Hey Fluttershy, isn't that Pinkie pegasus?"
"Well, she must have really wanted to hang out with you," said Rainbow Dash.
I had hoped to find the center of Equestria, a place where everypony belonged, but it wasn't to be.
Quin cannot be quite sure which was which, but she had seen the end of it.
It was a sunny day in Ponyville And they were packing up their toys.
"Twilight Sparkle, what's wrong with your eyes?"
Rainbow Dash reached over to cup her eyes to see just how dry and teary her eyes were.
It was a cold and dark and windy night and just before dawn Twilight walked calmly along the road that led to Twilight Castle, not looking down.
For years, little did you know, that the world was a far, far away place and all was quite well and well until it was all over and all was lost and forgotten and that when things finally got to the point where they couldn't get any worse, all was lost again and the End of the World and the end of all things had come, and I was only one of many, and all the rest were bad and miserable and very dull and silly and, you see, very old and very stupid and very sorry and very dreadful and very very nasty, and would have been quite easy to forget had it not been that they were all very little and very old and very pretty and very pretty and very pretty and very pretty and very pretty and very pretty and very pretty and very pretty and pretty and pretty and pretty and wonderful and much the same as ever before, I am now about to write down the details of everything that is known to me, all those I have seen in my life and all the rest that I have ever known or ever will known or ever shall know or ever will know or ever shall know or ever shall know or ever shall know nor do I know.
Twilight stood.
Rainbow Dash lay down on her hooves and reached for her glass of juice. 
The wind picked up, and the rain fell.
Twilight looked up at the sun, and wondered if she wanted to leave the Equestrian capital anytime soon.
Rainbow Dash lay down on her hooves and reached for her glass of juice.
Rainbow Dash stood up.
Rainbow Dash sat on the grass, head lowered, and peered up into the sky.
Rainbow Dash got up before dawn and stepped away from the distractions of her city.
Rainbow Dash stretched out her forelegs, rested the hind legs on the side of her neck, and looked around.
Rainbow Dash looked around the vast plain of the agricultural landscape that surrounded her castle.
Rainbow Dash bent down and peered up into the oak tree that sheltered her from the wind.
Rainbow Dash sat on her heels on the edge of a wide open field and peered down into the quiet green valley below.
Rainbow Dash watched the green, rolling hills away, then up toward the hills they knew.
Rainbow Dash stood at the foot of a great rock face.
"Who is it?" asked Twilight.
Rainbow Dash was asleep and thinking about food when she awoke to the sound of hooves approaching from behind the deep, dark, still trees of Equestria.
The day I was born was a beautiful day indeed.
When Applejack and Fluttershy were little girls, their parents kept the big store in Equestria Square and put a spinning wheel inside for each of them so that they could help themselves to whatever they wanted, if they wanted it at all.
Neo sat cross-legged on the ground, resting her hooves on the back of her head.
Applejack and Fluttershy sat cross-legged on the grass at the edge of the forest.
Rainbow Dash lay down on her hooves and reached for her glass of juice.
Rainbow Dash stood up on her hooves, and pulled her head back with one hoof.
Rainbow Dash laid her hooves on her forelegs and stared up at the sky.
Rainbow Dash was always a bit shy about ponies.
Rainbow Dash stretched out her forelegs and rested her hind legs on the side of her neck.
A bright blue friendship bracelet glittered
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes. She'd never been bad in her life, had she? She'd always been a sponge. A little like a strawberry. Pretty, even with a thin layer of frost on top.
It was a cold day, and the whole town smelled like urine, so they all packed their bags and headed for the nearest station wagon.
It was a cold, windless, and stormy day.
There's always a reason to do what old ponies do.
It was a bright, clear morning on my first Saturday in May, nineteen, and I was lying in bed in my family room, reading a book about Southern history, when a large, white pegasus flew into my room.
It started a wonderful little chain of events.
It was the day that the future of Equestria was finally decided.
It was the first day of August, and Earth was a very different place from if I remember correctly.
I'd like to begin with a somewhat lengthy disclaimer, as it may seem obvious that it's possible to misunderstand the meaning of any given term.
The sky was blue and the mountains were made of twigs.
When an ordinary citizen of Equestrian knowledge was given the power of a Teleportal, the need to travel quickly and affordably was forgotten.
It was a cold, windless, and stormy day.
A young man, a man of twenty four, he had the name of Erland, but for all that he was not a very good liar.
The sun was shining, and the trees were green and fragrant.
My name is Euphoriath Eliska, and I am the daughter of an old woman, who had twelve sons and twelve daughters.
The body of a remarkably amiable little girl, most probably named Isabelle, was lying on a beach in the Alleghanies, in a state of undress.
Sometime after four the sun rose over Dover, and when the crowd of people that was drawing near to the high houses of the city had crowded to the limit, and was beginning to be very considerable, the same old routine began to take its usual course.
Bones howl!
I had ever heard of a life-size print of the immortal flight-table six-foot-four-inch man known as the Solar Man, but in the year 1763 I had seen the most extraordinary thing in the world.
Unbelievable!
It was in the year 1763 when, in a county in western France, a small town named Vernay was formed, and the village of Neuve-Chalmers had its first residents, and the name and the first and only dame which has ever been mentioned in the history of France, was Mary Moodie, a little lady of twenty-one, with a pretty face, fine features, and freckles, who, with her husband, John-Morland, was well known in the world for her literary talent and for her indomitable resolution.
In the year 1763 the town of Andermour had its first inhabitants, and the first gentleman who has ever been mentioned in the history of Europe, was Sir H. H. Richardson, Esq.
The first case of lycanthropy that had been reported in a quarter of a century was brought to the attention of the medical authorities of the town of Andermour, on the eighth day of July of that year, by one Dr. Andrew Robinson, a surgeon, and eminent in health and in reputation, who, at the age of seventy-six, was living in the village of Andermour, in the county of Surrey.
My name is James Prentiss. I do not remember any years, and I have forgotten all my own.
The snow rose steadily from the eastern slopes, and the early morning mist that covered the valley had a pleasant yet sombre air of year-round peace.
When the ostrich-bird is ready to leave the egg-laying ground, it deliberately destroys its nest, and hides the place of its hiding place in what it calls "the dark."
I am a man of northeast European descent; my family is of Scotch and Irish stock.
The entrance door of the cuckoo's nest used to open on one side, when the cuckoo was satisfied that the birds had taken up their quills and stood still.

Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
You could feel the kiss.
Oh, come on. It's not me!
Rainbow Dash stopped and turned to look around.
It was a peaceful day.
Rainbow Dash was lying on her back, gazing up into the sky.
My name is Dash Saddlebottom, and I am a pony of great memory; when I was sixteen years old, I took the name of Twilight, and became the Princess of the morning light.
It is a story that has been repeated many times; but it is no longer true.
Although it's just a story of a capital, it rarely changes.
This is the story of the day that I discovered magic; it begins in the town of Burlap, a quiet little street of narrow houses, near by a stream, called the Corridor.
It was the middle of September, and the sun was sinking into the deep blue sky above the mountain, which was of course in the southern part of the state, where the river ran and the deep blue sea was surrounded by a verdant meadow.
Rainbow Dash was lying down under the wing of the red and white stallion named Eeyore, staring up at her blue and white Pip Puff.
"I don't think I'll be going back to school," she said.
Rainbow Dash was asleep.
She had waited all summer for her chance.
Fluttershy was beaming, when the sea began to rise out of the Pacific.
Rainbow Dash was sitting up in bed, staring out the window into a healthy, blue sky over the ocean.
"Miss Pegasus, your father said a trip of the Red Sea was a paltry matter, and that it was not worth the trouble."
When the sun rose, it was glorious, golden.
Rainbow Dash and Eeyore were laying in bed in the middle of the deserted lake floor, on a warm day in late February, when Applejack came into the room and slid her hooves over the sheets.
The sky was silver-gold and the sun shone down on the plains of the Great Mahal, where the deep blue of the ocean fluttered in the sun.
Rainbow Dash, without the wings of a stallion, was on the ground.
Once upon a time, there was a little town.
I am a student of history, and I hope you know that, for many years past, I have been engaged in an investigation that has resulted in many important discoveries.
This story is a sequel to The Twilights - a story that, with the exception of a few illustrations, follows a similar outline to that of the first novel.
There was once a town named Lysa, which was also called Hyrule, and where, in the reign of King Bream, there were many people of high birth, of noble birth.
Jade had spent the majority of her life as a woman.
It was a warm Wednesday afternoon, and how the summer air might have been turned green in the midst of summer, had not the news-teller, who was in the habit of reading out the day's news through the nose, predicted the hurricane that hit the coast of Melrose that evening.
McHale sat down at the bureau and clutched the reins of his mare.
A hot wind whipped up the old growing-pains, and the young boys of the village did not refuse to show up on the time; for a boy who was twelve years old, and who, no doubt, did not know any better, and who had been told that he was supposed to succeed in life, was one of the most agreeable creatures a boy could meet.
At first he just thought of himself, and was happy.
It was raining, but it didn't matter.
The king of Din as told a story, or at least a narrative, of a king who died suddenly.
The army of the Sorel that swept through the streets of Paris had been some days in advance of the arrival of the morrow when they found the ancient fountain that purred and the paladins of the cloisters that were its source.
"Good morning."
"Good morning, Minerva!"
Today I am going to tell you all that I have ever done for the purpose of enriching my friends in every respect, both in life and in literature.
The river that flowed from the river Styx to the sea of Rhaetian rivalled swift-flowing streams in the world.
Lemony Snicket was sitting in the field of our estate, looking at a photograph of a beautiful young woman, madly in love and not long since resolved to marry her, with the utmost circumstance of safety.
Maud would never have imagined it, least of all herself.

Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes. "Not a chance on the ground here."
Rainbow Dash sat on her haunches and looked out over the moon.
Serenity Alice.
The day he met Celestia.
"Uncle Buck!" the carol implied.
Rainbow Dash sat on her haunches and looked out at the moon.
"All right Twilight. Come on, it's the eighth time we've met. Alright — keep it up and we're out of here."
The first thing that started it all, Twilight thought.
Rainbow Dash was tired of riding the earth pony's back.
She was always tired.
Twilight remembered when she started at Equestria.
"Yes sir, we have three more quests to complete and our schedules are still not the same. I am sure that the youngest of your ponies will put up with your whining and your begging."
Fluttershy sat on her haunches and dreamed of a new world.
I realize that we are talking about something much, much older and far more fantastical than any of you.
"What is it?" Twilight asked.
It was midnight before the sun burst through the clouds.
Teddy sat on a nearby tower elephant and watched as the city of Ponyville, which had once been full of ponies and their ponies, had been completely transformed. 
It was one of the happiest days of my life. 
Rainbow Dash rested her forelegs on her elbows and let out a deep breath.
"Rainbow, why do you have the dark blue hair?"  the younger unicorn asked.
"Rainbow Dash, I have to say, I do think this is a good idea."
Spike lay in bed while his love fell in love with his bow and arrow.
Lightning fast!
Rainbow Dash rested her forelegs on her knees, and let out a deep breath.
The sun was shining brightly when the young royal was born.
"Rainbow Dash, come here."
The sand-colored sky was filled with the crisp, blue-green water that soaks into the sky months in advance of any human moment of opportunity.
Three sisters stood before the door.
It was a beautiful day in the Autumn of the year that Earth was created.
"Twilight Sparkle," the elder Princess said.
The earth is so small you could fit through it.
Rainbow Dash looked out onto the bright blue waters of a river that flowed through the middle of the desert.
We are going to talk about love a lot now, aren't we?
Part of me wanted to tell you that you wouldn't like it, because the idea of romance must take some getting used to.
Rainbow Dash looked over the map and saw more animals than her own family, and she looked out onto the world.
I think you should go see . . . .
It is a cold summer afternoon in Ponyville, and the air is saturated with the smell of death and the wind howls to the heavy rain.
Rainbow Dash leaned against the wall of the library, her huge body pressed against the paper, her hooves whinnying.
Rainbow Dash sat down in the grass alongside the river and watched the dresses of the other ponies splinter in the water.
First, the companions of the Crystal Empire were eaten by a dragon.
Dash the cow saw the two little ponies floating in the stream under the tree.
Rainbow Dash stood and watched her sister Dash the cow float by.
He was going back to Ponyville.
Rainbow Dash stared at the sea.
Rainbow Dash sat by her window and hoped that the sun wasn't up.
The sun was shining brightly when the young royal was born.
"I've always been afraid of flying. I've always been afraid of going anywhere."
I've always been afraid of the sea.
"I've always been curious. I've always been curious about magic. I've always wondered how it works."
Rainbow Dash blinked her eyes open.
Rainbow Dash shook her head.
There was once, a very long time ago, a princess named...   Thunderbird?
"Hey, no touching."  the voice behind her said.
Rainbow Dash sat down and just watched as her sister Dash the cow squatted beside her and watched her draw her bow and day out. 
- We're losing the war, Dinah. This is news. - I thought Rad, the geologist, the best friend of her entire life. but he was wrong. - No, it isn't. - I am not.

It is a fact that all life in the universe is made up of parts that behave in certain ways, those that seem to have some sort of purpose behind them. I have no
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
One morning, she woke up in the middle of the night, and there was a pony standing over her.
It was a quiet summer's day, and Rainbow Dash lay in the white sheets of an old-fashioned carriage on the back porch of the severely unfurnished house in the southeast corner of the city.
The day was sunny, and quiet.
The captain of the royal navy of the Kingdom of Icicle had just had his daughter married.
The next morning, the sun rose steadily, and the headaches faded a little more evenly.
One day, when it was entirely too late to change the subject, I was sali­d with fever at the nearest tepid stream, and felt myself in a terrible predicament; yet my mother had always spoken of a future when everything would be established and everything would be well, and there would be no more sorrowing sorrows and no more perplexities.
It was an autumn afternoon in the year of our Lord 947, and the beautiful town of Tors, on the north coast of Ireland, lay in ashes and its inhabitants crowded into the port and river.
It was a warm, misty morning in June, and the gentle wind of the Osprey blew in gently from the North and blew across the country in a gentle breeze.
By the late autumn of that year, the king of Britain had withdrawn from the council and from the politics of this mighty state.
It was summer, but the trees were still green and green-eyed, and the grass was still green and a good deal longer than it was when the flowers began to appear and perhaps prefigured the matter at issue immediately before their appearance.
The frost left no doubt that the scourge which is now raging across Europe had begun long before that exasperated race of people arose and began to notice the amount of snow in the fir trees and the abundance of it.
It was, perhaps, not a very grand tradition of the week of the disaster, but it was not without precedent.
The sun was shining brightly when the white stallion, burning with a burning passion, set out upon the lonely, winding road to the schoolhouse.
Titus, it is said, had no mind for politics, and neither for fame.
Walt shot Harry an envious look in the face.
The opening words of that story tell us as little about the future as the end of the world.
There was once a town in the heart of the wilderness: a rustic meadow with a almost rolling plain, wooded with trees of the firs, and in which, in summers when the grass was plentiful and the air turned sweet, a traveller might find a pleasant and hospitable house.
The mind of man—and I exaggerate it—is not meek, but it is slow and easy and, if we are to be believed, unembracing of authority.
She was standing in the doorway of the great hall of palace.
The great hall below, though it is still in the hands of the royal family, the main part of the palace is furnished entirely with the ornament of a palace, and the furnishings of a court, like the apartments of the princesses.
In the year of our Lord, 947, the sun rose steadily and went down evenly on the land of Ithaca.
The first thing you should know about my writing is that I write nothing else.
The sun was shining brightly when the white stallion, burning with a burning passion, set out upon the lonely, winding road to the schoolhouse.
She was standing in the doorway of the great hall of palace.
It was a big, red, jewel-boxed triremeter.
The moon rose slowly and steadily in the south.
The day was a very hot day.
The house was a house, and the house was very big.
Its windows were all shut, and the door of the house was always locked, but in this way it was possible to see very little of the city.
It was a hot, misty April afternoon in the year of our Lord, 947, that the white stallion, burning with a burning passion, set out in the lone and winding way to the schoolhouse.
The moon was showing in the east, shining again in the light of day.
It was a hot, misty day in the year of our Lord, 9, when a baby white unicorn floated over the water, and plunged into the depths of the swamp.
It was a beautiful day.
I made up my mind to mark a day, set aside for the purpose of a diary.
What my brother said made so much sense.
The great, yellow, curly thing was about five feet tall and a hundred pounds and squirmed its way around the trunk of the old oak tree.
The rain came down fast and lopsided and it cut the happy
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.


The clouds pushed back.
Ponies, once again.


She's not going anywhere.
Atop the clouds, the sky and the water rose.


The storm that blizzabummed over Equestrian hedonism every sunny day that summer was over.


I am not sure that I'm entirely honest.
I was just walking down a dark hallway in the back of a bus and there was a plastic bag over my head.
That's what you get for no name.
My name is Spark, and as you can probably tell by this picture, my childhood is not what it used to be.
As soon as the sun came up and the sun was shining and the summer days were warm and the river was running sweet, my mom Cristina asked me where I had been all winter long.
She was sitting in the corner of the living room of the house.
Storms were forecast before my very first birthday.

Dawn, and the sea brought it with it, the sea that stood over the coasts of the Eastern Kingdom of Equestrian, a sea that kept rising and falling and that seemed to have no end.
I remember well the first time I felt that I wasn't alone.
A light rain begins to fall on the East Coast of England.
The clock at the café reads 1:11 p.m.
She had just finished eating dinner with her family and was walking down the aisle of the car park of the local church when the first thing she noticed was the old journalist looking back at her from the rear window.
The moon was an emerald in the morning light; its light dancing in the cloudy waters of the gulf.

Stepping into the kitchen I knew immediately that I was going to regret this venture.
The moon is an emerald in the morning light; its light dancing in the cloudy waters of the gulf.

In the far southern reaches of the Sea of Values sat a small island called Oda's Pocket.
Garnet watched the sunset from the window of her room at the end of the house, her fingers pressing the slender small mirror against the tabletop in the middle of the room.
I do not, at the present writing, know the manner in which the ring is broken.
I am sitting at the desk of my sister.
Tall, thin, and fairly fair, a girl of seventeen with short, black hair and blue eyes, and with good complexion—a daughter of England, though not her native country—Dora Alder-y-Cole, was sitting alone in her room, in the light of a starry sky, while she had a thought; and the thought was, that, in such a country, which had so long been her own, very little had been left to her, and would be left to her,—that she might have some security, in the event of any eventuality, in the knowledge that there was none to protect her,—a thought which, when it was formed, bored her beyond all measure.
First known, at the end of the last century, to be the daughter of a girl of twenty-three, one of the statistics of Champlain, in that country, was that, after her father had been dead for ten years, she had the advantage of four years' education, and knew enough of the world, to be a good office seeker, and to be a good lever-broker, and a good carpenter, and, best of all, a good hatter.
As Mr. Swinburne stood at his office door, waiting to be summoned, he noticed that the door was open.
The sun came up brightly, and the sky was white with the foaming that it had been bathing in ever since the day that the genie had fallen from the sky and had brought the world quite to its knees.
"Send a runner," said the old man, and the old man made a noticeable effort to be friendly, although he knew well enough from his long experience in the city that the term seemed more than a little strange to him.
He had been walking very slow all morning, reaching his destination in the town of Trafalgar, about eight miles south of Manchester.
In the morning sun, when the clouds were clear and the rain was warm, a young man walked on the bank of the Thames, across which was a small island and a small cove.
I had never been much of a lover of books.
"Mister," said the man in the dress, "you have called me some other name than you."
The shop window, which had been ajar a moment before the accident, was just as it had been last night.
You want me to tell you what a stupid thing it is to live in the heart of the greatest capital in the world?
I always knew that there would be some kind of a problem.

====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
On one level, I think all of this is just wishful thinking.
The day I first met Fluttershy, she was four and a half years old.
I stood in the doorway of my office and watched through the glass at the wall as five ponies stood around a table.
The boys of the Moselle Clan—Truxton, Swiverdale and Shell Royal—had come down through the back door of the Moselle town house to attend the funeral.
Twilight blasted her horn into the air and dropped down to the floor, hovering there, impossible.
The rain battered on the windows of the manor house; the wind was the worst of the season.
Fluttershy stood on the bank of the River Apple, and she always did. 
Fluttershy, sitting on the bank of the River Apple, stood there.
One fateful day, growing old and becoming quite old, the Princess of Corona of the old kingdom of Equestria, the daughter of the King of Corona and Queen of Corona, saw the land change hands utterly.
Twilight Sparkle was wiping the sweat away from her forehead when she saw the light.
My name is Applejack Stable-Tail.
Hey, Applejack.
I was once a changeling, long ago when the land was still a desert, and before the stars ever rose in the northern sky.
The land was long ago, and it was long ago before the sun rose over it.
The trees in the meadow were so tall that they seemed to stand on the top of the mountains.
There's a story, I believe, that tells of a landlord who once had eight cows, but only one calf.
"Twilight?" said Rainbow Dash, her hoof hovering over the apple cart.
"Rainbow Dash, come on!" said Twilight Sparkle.
"I am sorry, Applejack," said Earth pony Twilight.
My name is Applejack Stable-Tail, and I am in need of good news.
I am unique among all the royal ponies of Equestria, and therefore, as the saying goes, the land is not in keeping.
My name is Applejack Stable-Tail, and I am in need of good news. 
There were always two stories, two realities, two worlds, two times—no two of them alike.
The princesses of Equestria loved Applejack. 
There was once a princess that was born and named Sweetie Drops. 
My name is Applejack.

A dark, bad cloud rolled low over Equestria.
In the year 17, when the Fourth War began, the stars shone brightly across the sky.
Rainbow Dash, swan, unicorn, and stallion of the I5 Armored Works, was on her way back to her office when she saw the great city of Ponyville once again.
She is a colt, and I am a galloping trebuchest, and I know how to shut up.
Twilight Sunset was staring up at her book, dazed and wondering when she would get the chance to finish it.
Rainbow Dash was on the pedestal of her bed, drooping down and frowning as she stared up at the stars. 
"Now I see."
It was an old story, the tale of a princess that had been born before the war
====================
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
 
A smile.
 
I am not sure whether it was the pegasus or the dragon's doggone kindness that wrapped their pinkie tracings around Princess Celestia's head as she walked through the door. 
“The town is small, but it is small in the sense that it is always. I am and am not. Never was and never will be. Only did. And only ever will be.”
“Sleep well, already,” I said.
“Darling,” said the stallion barely over my shoulder.
“You're going to make a terrible mess of this garden,” said the old stallion.
“Begone.”
“Oh, you've got me quite confused,” said the princess.
It was a simple tale.
Ned had dropped into the school, not knowing why he was there; it was as though he'd been dropped into the middle of nowhere.
I must have been sleeping for hours, if I'm remembering correctly.
The story of the frozen heart lies in the last word of the title page.
“I'm going to tell you a story.”
It was the early morning of May the 20th 1925, that I was summoned by a ludicrously long list of persons not named to attend a meeting of the House of Commons on the question of the status of the government and, of course, the paying and discharge of the debts of the Government.
The sun was shining bright in the cold and grey days of the mid-winter when the city of the Dead State stood upon the water and the mountains rose and fell in front of its gates in a manner that seemed to shock the very senses.
“I'm going to tell you a story,” said a man named Jimmy.
The clouds parted, the sky was still and the wind howled in the distance.
The young, tall, tan-haired woman stood before her desk.
Gramma sat down on the bench opposite her.
"What is it, my love?"
The sky above the palace seemed to be swallowing everything in its path, while inside the palace, the day air was pitch-black and the rain pummeled.
The sky was a sea of stars, bright and blue.
The old man stood slow, examining the unfinished work of his garden.
I would like to tell you a story.
The stars were dancing across the heaven, their harp music soothing and their beauty dazzling.
There is nothing like the smell of ashes.
The golden door of the cellophane-wrapped room was ajar; the boy was inside.
My name is Eös, and I am a slave of the ancient Thatch, but I have given myself to the art of writing, to the study of philosophy, and to holiness.
The storm raged all around her, keeping a sharp eye on the little hill that ran alongside the sea.
It was a chilly, dark and stormy morning, and Miss Doris Jarrow was helping her husband, the unfortunate James Jarrow, load his car when the first hysterical hearers started peering through the panes of the neighboring windows.
I took a low, narrow street in the southern part of Oxfordshire and there, in a little park, stood the house of Mrs. Carleton, with its neat lawn and neat green about it.
The water of the creek was clear, and pleasant, and nearly as clear as the sea is clear and pleasant and almost as pleasant.
It was a cold, damp day in April, and it was raining beyond belief.
The clock on the wall above the door of the house read thirteen-thirty.
The palace was burning in the middle of the night.
The sun gleamed on the western horizon.
One day, I think it was, my sister took me into the room where the little girls were playing, and there she laid out the dice with her, looking at them with an expression that said, "It's a long game, but you're playing it right."
It was about six o'clock in the afternoon of the third day of the fourth year of my mother, Mrs. C. M. Pillard, that I sat down before the fire and put the dice in my hand to play.
Mary died three years, to her great sorrow.
In the year of our Lord 2001, an elderly gentleman, known to friends as 'The Doctor', a cardinal, or the 'Pestilent', was sitting in the chair, with his hat on the mantelpiece, and the smaller man next to him, which was a very strange arrangement.
In the summer of 1763 the French general myself, jr. de Caverra, wrote, in the monthly magazine of the Department of Military

Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
Low, still, puffing in the coolness of the evening, the moon glared up with its yellow-blue streak of light on the horizon.
The story's over now twice over.
The first time we met the alicorn knight, in a dream, she had gone there alone.
With a tap on the table, the orange-haired stallion rose and began to make his way up the long, narrow stairs leading up to the black, vaulted cleaning chamber of the town home.
"You've proven to be dangerous, haven't you?" said the tall, dark-eyed stallion, peering through the open door of the airship.
The Arracan maiden who had been possessed by the spirit of a man bent only on destroying himself shivered and sat up straighter, but also with a much greater nervousness than usual.
"Well you've done well indeed," said the royal unicorn, as he sat down next to his brother, looking up at the heavens above them with a kind of dislike and a kind of curiosity.
Rain fell outside, heavy and cloudy, as though the sun had been waiting for the wrong day, and had trashed the city of Aerie for miles.
The snow piled at the base of the cliffs, stretching all the way to the top of the highest mountain, and rain always followed the winds.
There was a man in the courtyard of the king's palace.
The train rolled gently past the waters of the Bawkamg West, before it came to a stop on the opposite bank of the Sea of Clouds.
One morning the young princess had her doubts again.
The room was dark, the moon was out, and the air was filled with a cold, heavy, clatter of hooves on wood.
A bright flash and a low hum of thunder overhead, accompanied by a tremendous storm of wind and rain.
Tenebrae was a city of tall, ornate houses, of which the largest was the most magnificent.
Once, on a trip, my friend and I had planned to buy and sell some books.
They had only just arrived at the prison when the truth came out.
"There's a bad smell about this place, David," said the doctor, "and I don't mean the bad kind" -- the sort of smell that I used to associate with arithmetic homework and cattered-up plaster ceilings.
The man's name was Elysee Gray.
If I were a writer, I would have written a novel.
On the evening of the seventeenth day of July afternoon, 18,000 men and women, some of them alive, some dead, gathered at the gate of the town of the town to hear the execution of Dr. Augustin.
It was a cold Sunday night, and the sky was clear and blue.
The first thing you realize when you die is that you're dead.
The dead are dead.
As always happens when you die, your mind goes into a kind of rut, like a trance.
Lord, let me tell you of a thing that you can never forget.
The winds of winter blew hard, fast and clear, through the trees and the brush and the hedges and the savannah.
The moon was the brightest star of the night; a beautiful flaming star with a gleaming coat of brilliant blue.
The sound of laughter drifted through the terrible hall of the night, as though it had never been heard before.
The priest stood at the head of the altar, his lips parted.
Polly and I had been married for a matter of weeks now.
The smell of lavender, of earth, was overpowering.
The dead lie in the dark, and the living live near the wall of the temple.
The great stone wall of the church stood tall, large and strong, and draped with thick dark leaves, dark beyond the eyes of the young girls.
It was a prime, but the infant remains of the house were too small to comfortably bear its weight, for the house was eight stories tall and ten stories deep.
On a cloudless summer day in July, 18,000 men and women, some of them alive, some dead
In the end it's all in the mind, and nothing is absolutely certain.
The sun was shining brightly, and the air was full of the scent of fresh flowers.
The day when the peace of where, or the death of who, shall alter the course of the world--to say nothing of the fate of all mankind--is to be found on earth, is the greatest day of all the recorded history of the world.
Hewn priestess, have we any such thing as a Sabbath?
He had expected to find a dead body near the high-road.
Sparrow!
There was a young man in the full light of the morning, and he was

Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
The singing was just beginning.
The moon leveled off, and all around her her father sat waiting.
The sun was shining bright in the sky, bright enough to drown the sun itself.
"Aren't you going to go home?" said Sweetie-6, scratching her head.
The ponies were running, to and fro, through the tall grass of the old-growth forest, in their search of their home; but it was not for the grass.
Three moons, two days, one hour, and they were all the same.
Scene: The tide of the Gulf of Aydet (also known as the Gulf of Aelorne and the Pannonian Gulf) rises to mark the birth of the 13th Dynasty of the Aelia dynasty of sun and moon, and it is said that the day was registered between the first moon and the ninth moon, but it was the tenth moon that was recorded.
The morning was cold and grey, the air of the city of Hoofdsbrück and the city of Hoofdsbruck cold and thin with the early morning wind and the tepid but still aloft with the rich and thick damp of the river Thames.
She was a noble woman of twenty-seven, fair-haired, and had the gracious air of one who was warmly minded, not indifferent, but eager to please.
I keep my hand on my hip.
The sky was so clear and clear that we could see the atmosphere, and the stars, and the earth, and the sun, and the moon.
I used to like to play chess.
What some people call a 'theory of everything', a 'scientific explanation', is in fact quite a difficult matter.
The stairs to the office of a public official are lined with going-away cards.
The cloud of dust began to twirl and turn in the dry air.
You know, there was once a young boy named Kirk and his grandmother, who were both witches, and it was their custom to burn their dead children alive.
The Boy in the shining silver dress walks down a dark and winding street in the city of Pips, which is only a little more than a mile from the moated House of the Witch.
Out of the mist of a far-off dream, in the shadow of the elfin city of Mora, did a young boy named Peter Stamm, and his mother, and their friends, and the unlucky but wise Mrs. Peter Stamm, and their bad luck, until they reached the house of Mr. Manners, who was a stranger to them all.
In the beginning was the universe, and the universe came into being from nothing except a vacuum of nothing!
It was a storm.
I am writing this fictional history in the year 1759.
I shall not trouble you in much detail with all the discoveries and inventions of the time.
The sky was full of stars in early summer, but the clouds of darkness hid them from view.
It was not long after his marriage that the young man named Herbert Strang heard that the Government was preparing to file for capital punishment.
The death of my father was a terrible thing.
I am writing this fictional history in the year 1727.
Before he could afford to sit down to write, Mr. Joseph George Bryon thought long and hard, and then put the word in our hands, that in the year 1724, there should be brought before the General Assembly of the United Provinces, for the consideration of Congress, an act to authorize and regulate the punishment of persons convicted of murder or manslaughter, who have been formerly removed from the main coast of the United Provinces, to the coast of Nova Scotia, or the mouth of the bay, or to any other place where it may appear expedient; and to provide for their removal by such means as hereafter appear to be necessary and proper; and as for their dispersion among their neighbors, as a punishment for murder or manslaughter committed before that act had been passed; or possibly in consequence of this punishment, because they were then in the habit of murdering, it was the intention of the Legislature to regulate the manner in which they were disposed of, and to give them the protection of the laws.
The conflict were deep and binding, and either side had the advantage of the rest.
The air was alive with the clamor of battle.
John Barton stood on the bank of the river, and looked out across the marsh.
The sky was blue, and crystal clear; and the trees that stood tall and sturdy in the young growling torrent, as though they had never been cut down, looked like tiny whitened elephants, or gigantic but caged birds of fowl.
A sudden gust of wind obscured the sun and the stars from view.
The seven stars of the summer sky seemed to have disappeared from view, while all around them the darkness

Harry Potter had a lot of work to do.
He thought he was the only unicorn.
He'd been going through a bad time at the moment.
Blood from the top of the grass, a coloured smear, the colour of asphalt.
They were calling it the Pluto theory.
They were all those who were born before the Great Flood, those who were born before the earth showed signs of life, when it was a lush and green world where birds and animals lived together in perfect harmony.
The day the stars aligned, but which was the day it started, is a day I shall never forget.
"You're my best friend, go ahead," said a voice in the wide-open front door.
The world was spinning.
"I thought you said the Doral had been sealed off?"
Knock knock knock, knock knock.
The barking of the walker, along the road, rattled the cobblestone houses and the dark alleys of Oldbury.
Too early, your father won't be home to hear of it. 
There are still tall, thin trees that stand on the plain of the plain, high and lofty.
"Dorytheus, please get up," said the ferryman as he took the ferry down the winding stone steps into the harbor.
During the summer of the year nineteen six, two boys, Jeeves and Tom, played in the sand at the back of a deserted Ushuaia beach. 
As a boy, my father used to say that to make it through school you had to get up early.
There is no time like the present. 
The dark shadows of the tumbledown wooden house, the hatchlock open, the rain still beating on the windows, were barely visible from the street.
I have the gift and the power of prophecy.
The sun was beginning its slow descent down the left side of the earth.
Pony-that-was-me had stood by her father's side as he worked at sundown on the last day of the year two thousand and eight.
The night was cold and black and stormy and we had been trapped in iron-paved cellar walls for the past three days, and when the waves began to come, stepping down in front of the house that was our escape, we were half-deep in the water. 
When the wind blows, the sky is gray and the sea is black with the smell of salt, and the sun shines like a mirror, its face shining like a mirror of its own, and the moon, her head and her eyes like the mirror of a mirror, is like the mirror of a mirror—like the mirror that reflects the face of the beholder.
The writer had just come out of the wood.
The cart could no longer move through the snow, and the horses would not let it.
The earth was pink in the sky.
I am not a poet, but I am a good one. 
The sun is absolute darkness, the earth seems to be floating on nothing, the sky seems to be made of nothing, and even the stars seem to be unreal.
There is no heaven; there is only a house.
"Greater," said the man in the doorway, "and somewhat bigger than you are; for you are an acquaintance of Sir John Buttrick."
The moon was a golden-colored ball, and blue-white in color.
There was once a world, and it was long long since gone, but what remains is a world of good memories, and it is bright enough to be seen.
There was once a world, and it was long since gone, but what remains is a world of good memories.
When he was ten, at the age of fourteen, Theodore Roosevelt was invited to a party.
The suddenness of the passing distracted the man.
The night sky was a blue-green-blue-white-and-black mass of stars, and a star in the middle of it looked a dozen times as big as the rest.
The dishes were clean and neatly piled up on the counter.
Flowers bloomed on a hot day in the summer of 1792.
There was once a land of many names, and it was called Verdes, or the Lady of the Gardens.
"Go, behold," I said to my friends, "this is the final adventure of your lives; it is the darkest hour of your life; and there has never been a worse hour of your lifetime."
The little girl who was called Lucy came into the kitchen to find her father reading a journal.
It's a cold day in mid-June, but the moon is shining bright, and the air is thick with the air of spring: a good day to wintry heat, and a bad day to cold. 
I don't know how long I've been

"Back after the war, go and look for my baby, have a good weekend," said the childhood friend of the likeliest candidate for governor of the Commonwealth, the young, rich, somewhat rebellious Alicorn Trevelyan.
The next day I received an envelope.
Not only was the house ruined by the fire, but the kitchen also had vanished into the dark.
The first thing I recall, even if it isn't the one I remember, is waking up in bed in cold blood.
I don't remember anything we did that day.
That is, until I was seventeen, and I would imagine my head was spinning.
It was a good day for hunting.
It was a rut time in the Blackwood.
It was a cold Monday morning.
Truly wonderful.
It was October, thirteen years after the events on the moon known as the Moon War, and all was silent on the beautiful streets of Oklahoma City.
I sleep listening to the wind breaking the wheat and stirring the mille deal of the plains.
As the moon lifted its red tip and its sun soared high over the horizon, the ancient, wild, and fantastical world of the Far West began to emerge in broad white light.
It was a winter's day in the year 2329, and the dying worlds of the Upper and Lower Craters of The End Mirrored beneath the ice and snow of their respective basins.
The first time I saw the figure of a dragon, almost twenty years ago, it was just an observation, but to this day I still have a hard time believing that it was actually a human.
There was once a princess, whose name was Ama.
It is the mid-14th century, when Queen Elizabeth of, and her husband, King Edward the Third, have had their court at Westminster Abbey, in the vast chambers which are called the Palace of the Garter, and are partly occupied now by the privy council, and partly by their sovereign.
My name is Joseph. I am a man of thirty-three years of age, who have spent, according to my belief, an unending amount of time in every direction.
After my mother died, my father, who was then over seventy-three years of age, and at the time of her death had been married for twenty-six years, went into debt in the largest degree of debt he had ever incurred.
Three years ago M. Baudinot, who had been Assistant-Governor of North America, had the honour of hearing that in the year 1779 a new and very considerable controversy had arisen between France and England; and that the former had a right to treat with great violence, or to abandon the laws, that were established under their former alliance, upon the rights of which she was, as she claims, the first and foremost citizen, and as she had been herself when she was first formed, but as a subject, when they had embraced the crown of England, and had established the rights of citizens, which, however, they did not abandon, till after their union, but continued to regard as alien, and uncertain.
In the year 1765, when the reign of George III was at its height, a furious wrangle broke out between the House of Commons and the House of Lords.
In the year 1768 a young man named John Stuart played a very important part.
A palace on a hill, surrounded by endless green meadows, overlooking the sea and the mountains, and with a very agreeable air, from the woods on either side; for an ordinary house might be of no use to a traveller, or a lover of manufactures; and the Prince of the East of England might easily have been accommodated with such a palace; but the City of London had not the least pretension to the honors of its title, which ought to have enticed all persons, no matter what country they might be from; nor did it seem to the eye, that it was a city, not to be trifled with, nor defamed, by any name; but a palace, having a very agreeable air, and containing as many rooms as there were people in the whole City.
Dorothy of Beverly, one of the most distinguished ladies of the abbey of St. Peter's, who was admitted into the good order of the church only by consent of the vicar, but who at her death had been faithful to it ever since, was in her late baccus the eldest of the four daughters of the house; though her mother and grandmother had been very obscure in their regard to her, and she had often thought her grandfather a pretty poor particular; but in herself, she had been extremely wretched, and altogether destitute of everything she should have been able to procure for her; and after her grandmother's death, being very deprived of money, and very poor indeed, she had nothing but her imagination in her

"You missed it so much, didn't you?"
Three cubic miles of the Misty Mountains lie above Maple, the village where Twilight was born.
Bouncing between shades of grey, Weiss Sun and Moon, and the occasional pink-and-white sea of sky that the apple-tossed starship Aurora had thrown up in her wake, the blue-haired Pegasus sat atop her saddle and eyed the horizon from a vantage point of a single golden star.
A world of tall grass and waterbodies, cold and gleaming, where the stars shone brightly and those who dwelt there were happy.
"And what was the outcome?" asked the Princess.
"I was burned at the stake!"
In the dark, sparkling emptiness of space, where nothing but swirling blackness was, the old queen walked through the orphanage.
The king looked up in the air.
The sorcerer's apprentice, who knew nothing of magic, hastened on into the blackness beyond the stars.
"What did you do," the emperor said, "in the black?"
"I am going to kill some mares," the tyrant growled.
The great robot, the Mind-controlling Galactica of the Sith, the Hulk, that great spirit that began to crush the earth, the Destroyer, turned into the waters of the Dead Sea and sank in darkness, under the tremendous pressure of the great water of Noah's Flood.
The news of the slaughter in the south of France reached the palace at once.
The spray of blood reached the palace as the lightened, damp moon rose vividly behind the turrets.
When the Western Empire fell, the civilized peoples of the Empire, scattered by greed, feud and total war, had been scattered in various directions; as the old times of the West would have it, they had scattered all over the Earth, and were only now beginning to find their way home, they had remained scattered in various provinces, some of which had been largely without any part of the rest of the empire, made more or less independent; how the West came to be divided into those parts by fortune, and others by force of arms,—these things have been sufficiently told.
The time of the Great Dark, when men lay down to sleep, in the shadow of the great trees, to the sound of the gentle wind, or to the sound of a harp, or to the hum of the bees, or to the whispers of the nightingales, or to the strange silence of the deep, when the still air was filled with the odours of unripe beans, or sweet-smelling ripe figs, or ripe fig leaves, or ripe fig-trees, or the scent of sweet-smelling leaves, when the cold winter air of the old world, mingle with the sweet-smelling air of the new-planted fruit-trees, when the summers do not exceed eight or nine weeks in length, or do not have the cold weather of autumn, nor the sweet, or sour, or bitter taste of the leaves which they have, but are more of the air of the cold, or are sweeter, or sweeterer, or less bitter, or more agreeable, or more agreeable,—these things are already known.
Rain fell softly in the emerald greenness of the trees.
Twilight sat down on the bed and spoke.
"You're trying to kill me."
"What's the matter?" said Twilight.
Rain.
Rain.
Rain, always raining.
Rain.
Rain, falling hard upon the streets of Equestria.
Rain.
Rain.
A tall, silvery horse rode through the rain.
Rain.
Rain, falling hard and heavy upon the streets of Equestria.
Rain came hard upon the land and hard upon the eyes of Equestria.
The storm that had been brewing since the castle's rebirth had finally exploded into an unending stream of white light.
"This is not your father's ship," said the strong, sandy voice behind the wheel.
Rain fell heavily on the ground very late on the night that Gia's wedding day.
I have never seen Sabina so happy.
Rain, falling in bursts of white light, streaked across the sweet green plains of Equestria at the very time when Gia could not have wished for any more.
When she was twelve, in the early summer of that year, she had this dream.
The moon was full and the sky was clear and the stars of the night were blue and the sea was calm and the wind was pleasant and good and I was sitting alone in the dark at the back of my father's house in the town of Hestor, when I dreamed of a ship and of a ship that was sailing; and a white ship, having a white captain in her.
Right now I'm going to write a

Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
The bridge looked like a small city, but it was still without any streets or houses.
Eyes heavy with tears, thoughts of revenge, and thoughts of escape, Twilight Sparkle gazed down at her hooves, as if she could never forget to feel sorry for herself.
The day before she went to spend the summer with her friends, the very day she would die, Twilight fell off a roof and broke her back.
Spike died in the first game of the season.
"She's been sleeping through a whole lot of the words I used," Fluttershy said dryly.
How did you like the episode?
All this is a dream, perhaps.
There is nothing more cheerful than a happy ending -- and it was a happy ending, at least for a long while.
Twilight Sparkle woke up in a hospital bed and it was very dark.
"It's finally over. What a wonderful day, what a wonderful day."
"Hurry and get dressed!"
"This is the last time I'll ever be able to see Twilight, if I'm not quite dead yet!"
Rainbow Dash barked and hung her head.
"Rainbow Dash, are you all right? Hurry up and get dressed. You've got to be all right."
"Goddammit, my head hurts."
In fair weather, a lot of ponies like to go on a date or something.
The sun shone like a torch, as if it were having a spell on the horizon.
Rainbow Dash rolled over in a heap of snow that fell around her like a sea of gold in the middle of the night.
"What's wrong?"
Rainbow Dash had never imagined that she would be one of the subject matter of such a search, but even now it seemed that she was holding onto something which perhaps she wasn't entirely comfortable with.
It was only a matter of time before the deed was done.
But the moonlight sometimes dazzled the sappish air of the palace quarters.
"It's all right, Sweetie," the Princess said so sweetly, that her hooves shook the paper as she said it.
Twilight Sparkle turned around on her heels and ran to her bed, the one her father had made for her and Princess Celestia, to begin the long process of mourning.
From whatever source we could determine, a plague of minotaurs had suddenly struck Equestria.
Higher than permanent darkness, the space between stars is filled with the soft rumble of thought; the whisper of some unknown being that gives the impression of real intelligence, or that is sane, or at any rate of good judgment.
The sun had just come out of the east quadrant, and the moon was shining brightly in the shadow of the northern horizon.
Darkness continued to hover above the ruined streets of the city of Ponyville.
T A S E A D E D I S Caired phonic trumpet's low notes drifted over a deafening and weary populace, who had been summoned to the wretched land of Galt's whys after the war, when strange visions had threatened the future.
It was only through the power of the Goddess that my old friend and fellow-countryman, the eccentric and infamous Equestrian Clockmaker, Ankh-Dylon 'a, was able to find a willing audience.
Dumb.
Silly name.
It is said that the history of the world began on a single day in March, six years ago to-day.
When the clocks reach 6 o'clock, that is, when the town of Amadeus is one hundred and fifty miles from the sea-port at Vienna, in a city called Amadeus, which is situated on the same coast of the Sea of Marmion as Vienna, because the latter is situated on the same Gulf of Gallita, - Dan.
I have been told that it was not long ago that I was standing on my bed and thinking to myself: 'There is a thing called the English and the French, I suppose, who speak such beautiful English and such lovely French.'
When we lay in bed under the stars peering up into the endless depths of space and thought to ourselves: 'It must be a terrible nightmare.'
It occurred to me that my life was about to begin.
In the whole course of my life I have been, or have been at a great distance removed from the period of middle age.
Mamma, who had been talking to me all day, came in and sat down on the edge of the bed beside me and said: 'It is the great day of Mercy for the sick and persecuted.'
It has often been remarked in the course of my enquiry that I am an amiable, affectionate, amorous, passionate, independent, retiring personality; that in my life I have been engaged in a long and

I am going to tell you how I got to where I am and what I did.
There was once a yeti who lived on the peak of a mountain in the middle of an ice-covered sea.
They all knew it was coming.
I am going to tell you everything I know, all the things I've been told, even though I know nothing of it myself.

They had such a hard time of it growing up.
They swapped jobs all the time, like cockroaches in a blender.
They were two blocks from the school door and three blocks from the flat that always seemed to be the last place to put him when he went to sleep.
+A/N+ The story is told, or I suppose it was told in my mind before it began to happen, but the truth of the matter is that it has happened to me.
Everything starts with a girl. 
The wind howls and gongs, a plume of black smoke rising from the sea on which it floats and which, like a hurricane, sweeps away the dense grey wood and leaves that surround the old Arabian city of Moab and the yellow sandstone cliffs that rise over the sea.
The sun rose as one. 
He was guarding the magic mule when they blasted off from the mainland.
There was once a girl named  Kay, only five years old, but she had everything.
On the fifth day of the Great Gatsi lot, when the whole place had begun to come to a halt, the king was in full view of the hall of the palace.
In the beginning was the word clock. 
My name is Lomi, and I am forty years old, though I have been very much alive.
On a Tuesday night in September, in the clinic of a health club in the small town of Hulbert, in the county of Huron, a man named Ius Cornwell sat down at the computer to become a medical student.
It is in the genealogical books of the Old World that a man is related to his father.
A young man was standing in the street, smoking a cigarette and leaning against a tree. 
I am writing this sombre note to you as I write it, for your sake and the benefit of the reader, because your life has been one more step away from me for more than twenty-one years.
'No!' said I.
I have a newspaper and a notebook, one for every occasion, from which I have been able to record the circumstances of my life.
I should like to know exactly what happened to my mother.
My brother, Ned Erskine Croupe, was once a great shoe-maker, and lived an extraordinary life.
They said the world was flat; but it was never so flat as at Jönninghässleben.
The clouds towered over the sky, their white tops and crested tops and petals gleaming in the moonlight.
I have always felt that I was born with a particular obligation; and as I have never been more inflamed, more demented, than with this desire, of a cause and effect, of a teleological kind, I have always felt that I was born with a duty to society; and this is what has pleased me most; because being born, I am bound to do justice to my duty, or to the public good.
I count myself lucky.
He was a man of about fifty years' standing, with grey, auburn hair that shone like a diamond ring, sparkling eyes that glittered like diamonds.
The sun roars up, but we aren't there yet.
He was a man of about fifty-three years' standing, with grey hair that bobbed like a large reed.
He was stabbed in the throat, his heart ripped apart by the knife.
I have always believed that the earth has a soul.
The sun set, the horses died, the house was burned to the ground.
When I was a little girl my mother had me read The Life of Sir Walter Scott, and so after having written a hundred pages on it, I began to learn a great deal about it.
The moon was at her greatest splendour.
I was born in the year 1578, where the plague of the millenial age had most torn and torn, and the children of that age lived in darkness and in fear, as they do now, with a great deal of despair.
The singular thing about the world, with its strange and wonderful and wonderful things, is, that it is always moving.
The story of the last great voyage of Daniel, the son of Noah, is of extraordinary importance.

Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
I'm sitting in a desert of daylight and stars and I can't help but think, "this time is very different."
I found Mr. Sweetoof the haunted house.
I stood in the dark and watched as a large, dark, flying object crashed into the floor of the city below.
There was once, one day, in the ice-blue seas of Ith, in a land far, far away, that was called Oldworldland or... if you will, the Old World or Old Land.
Today I want your opinion on a certain subject which concerns me immensely.
'Agreed.'
In the center of one of the great cities of Carnus, who, being the name of the former capital, should have been a very large city of some considerable size, or rather "small" if we are to consider the enormous size of the city itself, and the size of the population which lived there, or the smallness of the provinces of which it contained, as the maximum size of a state, or even of an empire, or even of a kingdom, there was a small, squalid, and defenseless town, or a city city, that was so little that the walls and the ceiling could barely contain it, a very small one at that, and a very ignorant one, or at best ignorant; but which, and only then had any reasonable prospect of being used as a market place, or even as a strong harbour for anything but the most trivial vessels - that is, until quite lately, when it became a port, and accepted all manner of passengers, of whatever country or origin, or even of any description whatever, as passengers, and even took them by the hand, or rather led them in their behalf: but it was a town that was so little that it could scarcely contain it; very little also that it could possibly have contained, and yet it was not a small town at all: therefore, as I have already said, it was small, and not a very lively one.
The palace was the most magnificent palace in the kingdom of the Four Kings.
You saw the sword then, right?
There was once in the age of the Titans, in the land of the dead, there lived two men; one a god, the other a mortal.
The sky-blue-and-white world, the stage for the long-awaited ceremony, had been darkened by a gale of rain.
This is a story of a runaway princess.
The last thing I want to add to the events of this story is the fact that there were two people -- a human man and a completely evil giant -- who were in the habit of adorning their bodies with horns or enormous fangs, or with what looked to the thinking races of the time as big horns or flukes.
My story begins right here.
Dear friends, I write to you as a hope-netter.
The thin smile of the woman on the right swept across her gorgeous features.
When I grow up, I want to be a royal, a princess, a queen.
If you've ever been on the beach and looked out at the calm, blue waters that littered the shore, you will know that there are many things just as beautiful as sand and the sea.
The sun shone brightly on the sand, casting a soft glow on the rocky shores.
"Knight here, right on time."
"You don't know anything about little girls.""You and I both know that whenever I have been completely alone I have cried all the more tears because I was so young.""I am so glad I'm not your daughter.""Not now, either.""Not now, either.""I've been thinking about you a long time, miss. How wonderful it is, that you have such a bright, beautiful, energetic face, and such a sensitive, small, being.""I've always felt that way, no matter what. Just like you.""It's fine, Ruby. It's just a baby now.""I think about you a lot. I'd go as far as to say that it's my favorite memory of all time."
The sun rose slowly in the dark, moonless night.
My name is April.
In the summer of that year I was thirteen years old, and my mother had made me a pair of warm new boots for her.
The door to the house was opened, but my father's voice was not there.
I wasn't always such a strong, cheerful person.
How unfashionable it is to live in exile.
Miffal the Banderal was imprisoned no less than twenty-seven times on the Disc of the Dead, and it has been since then that he has been allowed a solitary passage out of his cell.

Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
A chaotic scene, simmering in the center of the dusty grounds, as the two Venture family business partners—the 'Ponies' of the name of the show—pushed their sleigh toward the smallest, fastest horseable hole in the ground.
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes.
A bright sun shined through forest of cypresses.
Rainbow Dash was walking in the quiet little town of Shadowmere, just like everypony else.
Rainbow Dash was standing there in the shade of the window of her mother's office, watching her mother's house burn down.
Rainbow Dash found the last of the  Firecracker hard to miss.
Rainbow Dash was in Ponyville, enjoying the speed and the air of the city.
Twilight Sparkle stood in the shadow of her mother's dusty glass cabinet, her hooves hanging down on the peg to keep her right eye steady.
Rainbow Dash sat up, leaned forward to see the sky and her Pony Ghost hovering just out of the corner of her eye.
Rainbow Dash sat down on the grass, her hooves lightly tapping the dirt.
Rainbow Dash leaned against the trees, her head resting lightly on the large, fat trunk.
Rainbow Dash leaned against the tree, her hooves strumming happily.
Twilight Sparkle peered over her shoulder at her mother.
Rainbow Dash gave a hoof, and her ears, a slight twitching.
Twilight Sparkle was back at the bank, shuffling her feet as she waited with bated breath for the check to come in.
Rainbow Dash's hooves stopped pounding the dirt beside the bank, and her eyes once more settled on the horizon.
Rainbow Dash leaned against the tree, her gaze scanning the atmosphere.
Rainbow Dash stood there, still wearing her royal blue dress.
Rainbow Dash, in her dress of flaring sleeves and falling skirts, with a slit just a little wider than the hem of her blouse, took a moment to admire the view.
Rainbow Dash stroked the buttons of her blouse, feeling the softness beneath her skin.
Rainbow Dash stroked her lower lip and watched, her eyes darting across the sky, her eyes trained on the alicorn.
Rainbow Dash stood in the shadows.
Rainbow Dash's heart hammered, her big blue eyes darting around the room, her face determined.
Rainbow Dash leaned against the tree, her hooves tugging at the bark of the trees, not sure if she liked it.
Rainbow Dash swung her hooves around.
Rainbow Dash wandered the quiet, wet wasteland of the forest, her eyes scanning the thicket just outside the thicket.
Rainbow Dash looked up at the stars and the sharp, gleaming colors of the sky.
Rainbow Dash stood in the dim light of the distance, her face downcast and blue eyes fixed on the ground below.
Rainbow Dash eyed her pale, blue-eyed lover, but had no intention of touching her.
Rainbow Dash took a deep breath, then her horn: the thrall of ambition.
Rainbow Dash stood on her hind legs, took a long breath.
Rainbow Dash looked around, minding her own business, when she found herself face to face with a sniping unicorn.
The night she met purple-haired stallion, Twilight Sparkle, the town was in tatters.  She had, for a change, decided to take the long way north, out of Ponyville, to a little hamlet; an old tale told by the other ponies who lived there, or on the plains, or whatever the crowd called it; the name of the place was Foebegotten, and it was on this little hamlet that Twilight had her first real experience of life in other people's houses; a true story, though told by very few of the people who lived in the village. No one ever suspected, for a long time, that the fairytales the royal family were reading to their children in the tower at the back of the royal court were in fact true; at least, that is what the stories told by the queen and her younger sister believed. No one ever suspected, for a long time, that the fairytales the royal family were reading to their children in the tower at the front of the royal palace were in fact real; at least, that is what the stories told by the queens and their friends, and by the academy signified by the name of the school, were actually true. (These are all, or at least some of the stories told by the royal family, which are remarkable mainly for their accuracy and for the extent to which they are true). Since the day she was ten years old, the royal family of Equestria had lived in a conspiracy of silence, perhaps the most remarkable thing about

Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes. Ephemeral, maybe, but all the better for the Princesses of the Royal Family of Equestria.
The girl looked up from the book she was reading, and the tear-streaked blue of her eyes seemed to say, I think we both know what we're in for.
I was born and raised in an era of magic and romance when my parents lived in a castle on a lake, and I never knew what magic was or who the hero was in her life.
I was born to be a planet princess, though not quite to that stage.
The moon was about to rise, and as the last of the sun set, Aurora could be seen over the sea of clouds, her golden beams dancing in the wind.
"It's settled."
He had endless dreams.
The greatest trick in the world was the inability to stop it.
The moon was rising, and there was nothing but light blue water to be had from the surrounding mountains.
The moon was setting, and the golden glow of the sun was fading into a pale blue.
The moon was gone.
The moon was still there, straggling lazily in the sky.
The moon was no longer there.
The moon fell from the sky, the last of it a deep blue.
The moon was only a quirk of the night sky; a person who was too young to have seen it, or even knew where it was in the first place.
The sun rose slowly, the dark of the day, at the expense of the mist of the valley below.
The sunlight outside the window revealed the dark shapes of the forest in the distance.

Sally her father was a detective, working in the North of England, and she said she'd never seen anything like it.

The moon was still resplendent in the light of the stars as the dowel-muffler hung from its neck, and over the city of London, where it was but little more than an ornament, a decoration, after the manner of the time when it was a very fashionable thing to try to impress your looks with things in order to impress your looks with, it was the thing of which the ordinary person would have a very bad idea.

"She's been looking for you since that troll came through in the middle of the night!"
"Me too, mare-pony," gushed Applejack, her eyes sparkling as she turned the thick chain of grass around her to the side.
It was the only reason to do it, the only reason that I knew to do it, and I believe I can prove to you that there was only one sole reason to do it, that I was attempting to achieve a goal Jove never wished to see me accomplish, and that goal was to achieve his own personal, personal goals without fail, and in the hope that he would grant me my ultimate goal.

At the end of that terrible day when the world was at last beginning to make sense, when the world held its breath all night, when every hard thing that a mind can conceive must face the harsh fact of death, my grandfather, Mr. John Burroughs, of the Burroughs family of the Little Walker, in Buckinghamshire, came back to London in a state of great elation, and thought with the greatest contentment that at least he had succeeded in getting off so badly that he might never again be forced to make such a terrible mistake.

Mare in a free state should have the right to vote and to be elected, and yet in the days when the royal family was nominally hereditary it was not uncommon for at least one member of the family to have electoral rights, although there never was any reason to suppose that she was anything more than that; so that the majority of the population had a vote in the matter of electing their king, or rather their king's daughter.

Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes. She had been long and rambling, and had a lot to address. Oh yeah, oh yeah, just twenty-one minutes long. Well. That means just eighteen minutes. But that doesn't matter, because on top of that she was already coming up with a whole bunch of ways to torture me.

I am no longer a child, nor am I supposed to be, and I do not pretend to be.

Christmas came early, and so did the shopping trip.
In the summer of this year I was born in the East Midlands, in a house now known with the same name, where the walls and ceilings have been taken out and plastered over with snow, and where, for nearly a century and a half, and then only five years, has been the scene of numerous and uneasy changes and unavailing adventures, and which, until its ruin, has been called by the same name entirely again, 'Blackwall.

It was a hot and windy day; but for the sake of the time, and because it was the hottest day of the year, the weather-mill, which was in use at the time, in the same town, at the same time, and in the same way as it is now, must have been very hot indeed.

The sunlight shone on the enormous lump of green that was the frontier between the realms of light and the dark.

It was a sunny afternoon in the summer of your father's year, and you were driving from your home in the village of Dotchey to the big house in the town of Marlow, with its big front yard and its big back yard, and some of the neatest houses you'd ever seen, and your father's old yellow-brick carriage and you and your mother and the horses hanging from the ceiling, and no one had ever looked down on either of you, mind you; everyone had never looked at the horses.
When the white clouds overhead began to move, you were riding in the midst of dry and cool, but they knew you from the look of you, and they knew you from the way you rode, and as the sky cleared you were riding on clear, and you knew that the wind was blowing, and that you were safe, and that you would have to ride on, and now you are riding, and you are riding, and you know that if you were found hanging in the morning you would have to lie here all night, and you are, if you please, riding.
It was not easy to believe that I was the daughter of a statesman, of a noble family, or of a vintner, a merchant, or a dame.
The first thing that came to my mind when I heard the cry of alarm, the scream of terror, the booming screams of the circus galloping towards my room, was that I might, if necessary, have covered it with my own blood.
When you're thrown out of a castle into the wilds of October, and there's a man there, and he has been murdered, and the dead man has been hoping to be rid of him for a hundred years, you think the world is over.
And tearing his father's arm off, he did not spring a foot.
He was riding in the midst of a dry and calm autumn season, riding on clear, and he knew that the wind of Britain was blowing, and that he was safe and that he would have to ride on—it was a familiar feeling to him—and he was riding on comfortable white, and he knew that the air was cool and that if he was found hanged he could always lie down for a long time and sleep peacefully and rest easy.
Her father had passed away a few years before, but she had not forgotten that he had been a force in the history of the land.
