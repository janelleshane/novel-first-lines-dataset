# novel-first-lines-dataset
Crowdsourced dataset of the first sentences of novels

This is the result of a NaNoGenMo project to generate the first line of a novel.

At the beginning of November, a tiny dataset produced mixed results in my first attempt to generate the first sentence of a novel http://aiweirdness.com/post/167049313837/a-neural-network-tries-writing-the-first-sentence

Highlights:

> There was a man and he had seventy first sight.

> It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of my life, fire of my loins.

Lowlights:

> Stop! I caused the Narguuse man who was new on Alabama, the screaming constipated eggs.
> I am an angry grass, the symposium square, proved fatal to the throbbing, the howling wind tire…

The really big repositories I've found (Project Gutenburg, for example) are formatted inconsistently enough that they're difficult to scrape.

So I crowdsourced a larger dataset: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScod8P-kcLX98u6gT0rX6-20GwkDo_glz-okVVkrhr6KgQONQ/viewform. 
It has been posted since the first week of November 2017 and as of 28 November 2017 has 11,135 submissions (not all unique). 
The form is still open for submissions, and I may update this repository from time to time if the dataset size grows significantly. 
Dataset stats:

- 11135 entries, some with authors and titles included
- Some are from existing books; some are from in-progress manuscripts; some are from short stories.
- Names of authors and titles are not standardized, nor are typos corrected.
- Almost all entries are in English.

Example raw output from syll-rnn trained on this dataset (first letter of sentence and single I have been capitalized in post-processing, since syll-rnn doesn't preserve capitalization):
